ms,1,10 essential performance tips for MySQL,,,,,
ms,1,"From workload profiling to the three rules of indexing, these expert insights are sure to make your MySQL servers scream",,,,,
ms,1,By Baron Schwartz,,,,,
ms,1,InfoWorld |,,,,,
ms,1,Thinkstock,,,,,
ms,1,"As with all relational databases, MySQL can prove to be a complicated beast, one that can crawl to a halt at a moment’s notice, leaving your applications in the lurch and your business on the line",,,,,
ms,1,"The truth is, common mistakes underlie most MySQL performance problems",,,,,
ms,1,"To ensure your MySQL server hums along at top speed, providing stable and consistent performance, it is important to eliminate these mistakes, which are often obscured by some subtlety in your workload or a configuration trap",,,,,
ms,1,,,,,,
ms,1,[ Database slow? Improve the speed and scalability of your RDBMS with these 21 rules for faster SQL queries,,,,,

ms,1,],,,,,
ms,1,"Luckily, many MySQL performance issues turn out to have similar solutions, making troubleshooting and tuning MySQL a manageable task",,,,,
ms,1,Here are 10 tips for getting great performance out of MySQL,,,,,
ms,1,MySQL performance tip No,,,,,
ms,1,1: Profile your workloadThe best way to understand how your server spends its time is to profile the server’s workload,,,,,
ms,1,"By profiling your workload, you can expose the most expensive queries for further tuning",,,,,
ms,1,"Here, time is the most important metric because when you issue a query against the server, you care very little about anything except how quickly it completes",,,,,
ms,1,The best way to profile your workload is with a tool such as MySQL Enterprise Monitor’s query analyzer or the pt-query-digest from the Percona Toolkit,,,,,
ms,1,"These tools capture queries the server executes and return a table of tasks sorted by decreasing order of response time, instantly bubbling up the most expensive and time-consuming tasks to the top so that you can see where to focus your efforts",,,,,
ms,1,"Workload-profiling tools group similar queries together, allowing you to see the queries that are slow, as well as the queries that are fast but executed many times",,,,,
ms,1,,,,,,
ms,1,MySQL performance tip No,,,,,
ms,1,"2: Understand the four fundamental resourcesTo function, a database server needs four fundamental resources: CPU, memory, disk, and network",,,,,
ms,1,"If any of these is weak, erratic, or overloaded, then the database server is very likely to perform poorly",,,,,
ms,1,Understanding the fundamental resources is important in two particular areas: choosing hardware and troubleshooting problems,,,,,
ms,1,"When choosing hardware for MySQL, ensure good-performing components all around",,,,,
ms,1,"Just as important, balance them reasonably well against each other",,,,,
ms,1,"Often, organizations will select servers with fast CPUs and disks but that are starved for memory",,,,,
ms,1,"In some cases, adding memory is a cheap way of increasing performance by orders of magnitude, especially on workloads that are disk-bound",,,,,
ms,1,"This might seem counterintuitive, but in many cases disks are overutilized because there isn’t enough memory to hold the server’s working set of data",,,,,
ms,1,Another good example of this balance pertains to CPUs,,,,,
ms,1,"In most cases, MySQL will perform well with fast CPUs because each query runs in a single thread and can’t be parallelized across CPUs",,,,,
ms,1,"When it comes to troubleshooting, check the performance and utilization of all four resources, with a careful eye toward determining whether they are performing poorly or are simply being asked to do too much work",,,,,
ms,1,This knowledge can help solve problems quickly,,,,,
ms,1,MySQL performance tip No,,,,,
ms,1,3: Don’t use MySQL as a queueQueues and queue-like access patterns can sneak into your application without your knowing it,,,,,
ms,1,"For example, if you set the status of an item so that a particular worker process can claim it before acting on it, then you’re unwittingly creating a queue",,,,,
ms,1,"Marking emails as unsent, sending them, then marking them as sent is a common example",,,,,
ms,1,"Queues cause problems for two major reasons: They serialize your workload, preventing tasks from being done in parallel, and they often result in a table that contains work in process as well as historical data from jobs that were processed long ago",,,,,
ms,1,Both add latency to the application and load to MySQL,,,,,
ms,1,MySQL performance tip No,,,,,
ms,1,"4: Filter results by cheapest firstA great way to optimize MySQL is to do cheap, imprecise work first, then the hard, precise work on the smaller, resulting set of data",,,,,
ms,1,"For example, suppose you’re looking for something within a given radius of a geographical point",,,,,
ms,1,The first tool in many programmers’ toolbox is the great-circle (Haversine) formula for computing distance along the surface of a sphere,,,,,
ms,1,"The problem with this technique is that the formula requires a lot of trigonometric operations, which are very CPU-intensive",,,,,
ms,1,Great-circle calculations tend to run slowly and make the machine’s CPU utilization skyrocket,,,,,
ms,1,"Before applying the great-circle formula, pare down your records to a small subset of the total, and trim the resulting set to a precise circle",,,,,
ms,1,A square that contains the circle (precisely or imprecisely) is an easy way to do this,,,,,
ms,1,"That way, the world outside the square never gets hit with all those costly trig functions",,,,,
ms,1,MySQL performance tip No,,,,,
ms,1,5: Know the two scalability death trapsScalability is not as vague as you may believe,,,,,
ms,1,"In fact, there are precise mathematical definitions of scalability that are expressed as equations",,,,,
ms,1,These equations highlight why systems don’t scale as well as they should,,,,,
ms,1,"Take the Universal Scalability Law, a definition that is handy in expressing and quantifying a system’s scalability characteristics",,,,,
ms,1,It explains scaling problems in terms of two fundamental costs: serialization and crosstalk,,,,,
ms,1,Parallel processes that must halt for something serialized to take place are inherently limited in their scalability,,,,,
ms,1,"Likewise, if the parallel processes need to chat with each other all the time to coordinate their work, they limit each other",,,,,
ms,1,"Avoid serialization and crosstalk, and your application will scale much better",,,,,
ms,1,"What does this translate into inside of MySQL? It varies, but some examples would be avoiding exclusive locks on rows",,,,,
ms,1,"Queues, point No",,,,,
ms,1,"3 above, tend to scale poorly for this reason",,,,,
ms,1,MySQL performance tip No,,,,,
ms,1,6: Don’t focus too much on configurationDBAs tend to spend a huge amount of time tweaking configurations,,,,,
ms,1,The result is usually not a big improvement and can sometimes even be very damaging,,,,,
ms,1,"I’ve seen a lot of “optimized” servers that crashed constantly, ran out of memory, and performed poorly when the workload got a little more intense",,,,,
ms,1,"The defaults that ship with MySQL are one-size-fits-none and badly outdated, but you don’t need to configure everything",,,,,
ms,1,It’s better to get the fundamentals right and change other settings only if needed,,,,,
ms,1,"In most cases, you can get 95 percent of the server’s peak performance by setting about 10 options correctly",,,,,
ms,1,The few situations where this doesn’t apply are going to be edge cases unique to your circumstances,,,,,
ms,1,"In most cases, server “tuning” tools aren’t recommended because they tend to give guidelines that don’t make sense for specific cases",,,,,
ms,1,"Some even have dangerous, inaccurate advice coded into them – such as cache hit ratios and memory consumption formulas",,,,,
ms,1,"These were never right, and they have become even less correct as time has passed",,,,,
ms,1,MySQL performance tip No,,,,,
ms,1,7: Watch out for pagination queriesApplications that paginate tend to bring the server to its knees,,,,,
ms,1,"In showing you a page of results, with a link to go to the next page, these applications typically group and sort in ways that can’t use indexes, and they employ a LIMIT and offset that cause the server to do a lot of work generating, then discarding rows",,,,,
ms,1,Optimizations can often be found in the user interface itself,,,,,
ms,1,"Instead of showing the exact number of pages in the results and links to each page individually, you can just show a link to the next page",,,,,
ms,1,You can also prevent people from going to pages too far from the first page,,,,,
ms,1,"On the query side, instead of using LIMIT with offset, you can select one more row than you need, and when the user clicks the “next page” link, you can designate that final row as the starting point for the next set of results",,,,,
ms,1,"For example, if the user viewed a page with rows 101 through 120, you would select row 121 as well; to render the next page, you’d query the server for rows greater than or equal to 121, limit 21",,,,,
ms,1,ySQL performance tip No,,,,,
ms,1,"8: Save statistics eagerly, alert reluctantlyMonitoring and alerting are essential, but what happens to the typical monitoring system? It starts sending false positives, and system administrators set up email filtering rules to stop the noise",,,,,
ms,1,Soon your monitoring system is completely useless,,,,,
ms,1,I like to think about monitoring in two ways: capturing metrics and alerting,,,,,
ms,1,It’s very important to capture and save all the metrics you possibly can because you’ll be glad to have them when you’re trying to figure out what changed in the system,,,,,
ms,1,"Someday, a strange problem will crop up, and you’ll love the ability to point to a graph and show a change in the server’s workload",,,,,
ms,1,"By contrast, there’s a tendency to alert way too much",,,,,
ms,1,People often alert on things like the buffer hit ratio or the number of temporary tables created per second,,,,,
ms,1,The problem is that there is no good threshold for such a ratio,,,,,
ms,1,"The right threshold is not only different from server to server, but from hour to hour as your workload changes",,,,,
ms,1,"As a result, alert sparingly and only on conditions that indicate a definite, actionable problem",,,,,
ms,1,"A low buffer hit ratio isn’t actionable, nor does it indicate a real issue, but a server that doesn’t respond to a connection attempt is an actual problem that needs to be solved",,,,,
ms,1,MySQL performance tip No,,,,,
ms,1,9: Learn the three rules of indexingIndexing is probably the most misunderstood topic in databases because there are so many ways to get confused about how indexes work and how the server uses them,,,,,
ms,1,It takes a lot of effort to really understand what’s going on,,,,,
ms,1,"Indexes, when properly designed, serve three important purposes in a database server:",,,,,
ms,1,Indexes let the server find groups of adjacent rows instead of single rows,,,,,
ms,1,"Many people think the purpose of an index is to find individual rows, but finding single rows leads to random disk operations, which is slow",,,,,
ms,1,"It’s much better to find groups of rows, all or most of which are interesting, than to find rows one at a time",,,,,
ms,1,,,,,,
ms,1,Indexes let the server avoid sorting by reading the rows in a desired order,,,,,
ms,1,Sorting is costly,,,,,
ms,1,Reading rows in the desired order is much faster,,,,,
ms,1,,,,,,
ms,1,"Indexes let the server satisfy entire queries from the index alone, avoiding the need to access the table at all",,,,,
ms,1,This is variously known as a covering index or an index-only query,,,,,
ms,1,,,,,,
ms,1,"If you can design your indexes and queries to exploit these three opportunities, you can make your queries several orders of magnitude faster",,,,,
ms,1,MySQL performance tip No,,,,,
ms,1,10: Leverage the expertise of your peersDon’t try to go it alone,,,,,
ms,1,"If you’re puzzling over a problem and doing what seems logical and sensible to you, that’s great",,,,,
ms,1,This will work about 19 times out of 20,,,,,
ms,1,"The other time, you’ll go down a rabbit hole that will be very costly and time-consuming, precisely because the solution you’re trying seems to make a lot of sense",,,,,
ms,1,Build a network of MySQL-related resources – and this goes beyond toolsets and troubleshooting guides,,,,,
ms,1,"There are some extremely knowledgeable people lurking on mailing lists, forums, Q&A websites, and so on",,,,,
ms,1,"Conferences, trade shows, and local user group events provide valuable opportunities for gaining insights and building relationships with peers who can help you in a pinch",,,,,
ms,1,"For those looking for tools to complement these tips, you can check out the Percona Configuration Wizard for MySQL, Percona Query Advisor for MySQL, and Percona Monitoring Plugins",,,,,
ms,1,(Note: You’ll need to create a Percona account to access those first two links,,,,,
ms,1,It’s free,,,,,
ms,1,The configuration wizard can help you generate a baseline my,,,,,
ms,1,cnf file for a new server that’s superior to the sample files that ship with the server,,,,,
ms,1,The query advisor will analyze your SQL to help detect potentially bad patterns such as pagination queries (No,,,,,
ms,1,7),,,,,
ms,1,Percona Monitoring Plugins are a set of monitoring and graphing plugins to help you save statistics eagerly and alert reluctantly (No,,,,,
ms,1,8),,,,,
ms,1,All of these tools are freely available,,,,,

ms,2,30 Jul 2020,,,,,
ms,2,"If you pride yourself on your SQL optimization skills, then this is a good time to advance your MySQL performance tuning",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"For one thing, MySQL has spent the last seven years as a very close #2 in the race with #1- Oracle and #3- Microsoft SQL Server, according to DB-Engines",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"For another, MySQL is an open source database, something you can’t say about #1 or #3",,,,,
ms,2,"If you and your fellow database professionals are gravitating toward open source, MySQL is currently the one to beat",,,,,
ms,2,"It’s available on FreeBSD, Linux, OS X, Solaris and Windows",,,,,
ms,2,"It supports almost 20 different programming languages, from Ada to Tcl, which means it has something for just about every developer",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"And, MySQL has made recent news by changing obsolete terminology written into its source code and documentation",,,,,
ms,2,Their creators and engineers are paying attention,,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,The need for MySQL performance tuning,,,,,
ms,2,"But even with the #2 database, you can still write inefficient SQL statements and launch queries that run slowly",,,,,
ms,2,"For that, there’s MySQL performance tuning, which I’ll describe in the five tips below",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Tip 1: Monitor wait time,,,,,
ms,2,How long are your users waiting for a response from the database? MySQL provides wait events and thread states to help you answer that question,,,,,
ms,2,"By monitoring each step that a SQL statement takes in the database until it sends back a response, you draw a clear picture of where the query spends time",,,,,
ms,2,And that’s where you start your MySQL performance tuning,,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"In early versions of MySQL, you couldn’t look at the Performance_Schema database or the Information_Schema database without causing locking or affecting performance",,,,,
ms,2,"Nowadays, MySQL offers better information on both current and historical events at the levels of statements, stages and waits",,,,,
ms,2,"For example, the number of tables in Performance_Schema that you can query for tuning information grew from 17 to 87 between versions 5.5 and 5.7",,,,,
ms,2,Version 8 includes a transactional data dictionary for the database objects (you’ll query those in Tip 3) that used to be stored only in underlying files,,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Query for wait time data,,,,,
ms,2,Start your MySQL performance tuning with this query on the main tables associated with wait time:,,,,,
ms,2,INSERT INTO wta_data SELECTt,,,,,
ms,2,"processlist_id AS conn_id, t",,,,,
ms,2,"processlist_user AS user, t",,,,,
ms,2,"processlist_host AS host, t",,,,,
ms,2,"processlist_db AS db, LOWER(t",,,,,
ms,2,"processlist_state) AS state, t",,,,,
ms,2,"processlist_info AS current_sql, MD5(t",,,,,
ms,2,"processlist_info) AS current_sql_md5, t",,,,,
ms,2,"processlist_command AS command, w",,,,,
ms,2,"event_id AS wait_event_id, w",,,,,
ms,2,"end_event_id AS wait_event_end_id, w",,,,,
ms,2,"event_name AS wait_event_name, w",,,,,
ms,2,"operation AS wait_operation, w",,,,,
ms,2,"object_schema AS wait_schema, w",,,,,
ms,2,"object_name AS wait_object_name, w",,,,,
ms,2,"object_type AS wait_type, w",,,,,
ms,2,"index_name AS wait_index, s",,,,,
ms,2,"sql_text AS statement_sql, MD5(s",,,,,
ms,2,"sql_text) AS statement_sql_md5, CASE WHEN RIGHT(s",,,,,
ms,2,"digest_text, 3)= '",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS statement_digest_truncated, s",,,,,
ms,2,"digest AS statement_digest, s",,,,,
ms,2,"event_id AS statement_event_id, s",,,,,
ms,2,"end_event_id AS statement_event_end_id, conn",,,,,
ms,2,attr_value AS program_nameFROM performance_schema,,,,,
ms,2,threads AS t LEFT JOINperformance_schema,,,,,
ms,2,events_waits_current AS w ON w,,,,,
ms,2,thread_id = t,,,,,
ms,2,thread_idAND w,,,,,
ms,2,end_event_id IS NULL AND w,,,,,
ms,2,event_name <> 'idle'LEFT JOIN performance_schema,,,,,
ms,2,events_statements_current AS s ON s,,,,,
ms,2,thread_id= t,,,,,
ms,2,thread_id AND s,,,,,
ms,2,"digest IS NOT NULLLEFT JOIN (SELECT processlist_id, GROUP_CONCAT(attr_value ORDER BYattr_name DESC SEPARATOR '~^~') attr_valueFROM performance_schema",,,,,
ms,2,"session_connect_attrs WHERE attr_name IN('program_name','_client_name') GROUP BY processlist_id ) connON t",,,,,
ms,2,processlist_id = conn,,,,,
ms,2,processlist_idWHERE t,,,,,
ms,2,instrumented = 'YES' AND t,,,,,
ms,2,processlist_id <> connection_id()AND (t,,,,,
ms,2,PROCESSLIST_COMMAND <> 'Sleep');Notice that the query excludes threads containing a Sleep command and those with a wait event of idle,,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"To study wait time, run that query repeatedly at some interval — say, one minute — and save the results to a table (here, wta_data)",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Find the queries that are spending the most time in the database,,,,,
ms,2,"Now run a query that groups the data by sql_text, wait_operation and time_in_seconds for each wait event, then sums the total time the query spends",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,select w,,,,,
ms,2,"sql_text, w",,,,,
ms,2,"wait_operation, w",,,,,
ms,2,"time_in_seconds, tot",,,,,
ms,2,"tot_time from(select substr(current_sql, 1, 60) sql_text,",,,,,
ms,2,"wait_operation, count(*) time_in_seconds",,,,,
ms,2,"from wta_data w group by substr(current_sql, 1, 60), wait_operation) w c(select substr(current_sql, 1,60) sql_text, count(*) tot_time",,,,,
ms,2,from wta_data,,,,,
ms,2,"group by substr(current_sql, 1,60)) totwhere w",,,,,
ms,2,wait_operation is not nulland w,,,,,
ms,2,sql_text = tot,,,,,
ms,2,sql_textorder by tot,,,,,
ms,2,"tot_time, time_in_seconds;",,,,,
ms,2,"Then, examine the query output (this is from a sample database for a rental company):",,,,,
ms,2,The middle two rows reveal that one SQL statement spent 21 seconds on a read and 56 times that long (1183 seconds) on a fetch,,,,,
ms,2,The bottom two rows show that another SQL statement spent 39 seconds on a read and 35 times that long (1370 seconds) on a fetch,,,,,
ms,2,That’s an awful lot of fetching for not much reading,,,,,
ms,2,"Clearly, there’s room for improvement",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Analyzing wait time reveals important baseline metrics you’ll need in MySQL performance tuning,,,,,
ms,2,"In this case, the focus is on the big difference between rows examined and rows sent",,,,,
ms,2,Average wait time itself is another useful metric,,,,,
ms,2,"Baseline metrics allow you to set a tuning target, when you can say, “That’s good enough",,,,,
ms,2,Then you move on to the next performance problem,,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Tip 2: Review the execution plan,,,,,
ms,2,The execution plan reveals the cost of each operation,,,,,
ms,2,"That helps you find the most expensive steps, such as I/O (rows examined, rows sent), full table scans, index scans, filtering predicates and column data types",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,MySQL gives you several options for generating an execution plan:,,,,,
ms,2,Run explain from a command prompt,,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"Running EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON generates a JSON-formatted explain plan with extended and partition information, plus detail on the operations including which part of the key was used",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"SET OPTIMIZER_TRACE=""ENABLED=ON""; puts the trace in memory to write information to the optimizer_trace table in information_schema",,,,,
ms,2,It captures the costs of all the operations that the optimizer considered for the current plan (version 5.6.3 and above),,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"MySQL Workbench offers a graphical view of the plan, shown below",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"That execution plan shows table name, type of data access, references and the number of rows that the optimizer estimates it will examine when it runs — all useful in MySQL performance tuning",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"In general, the earlier in your query that you apply filtering predicates, the less data you discard later",,,,,
ms,2,The execution plan makes it easy to see how early or late your query is applying filters,,,,,
ms,2,"Does your query launch any temporary or filesort activities? If so, the execution plan shows you where they occur so you can try to reduce the amount of data you’re sending to them",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"Note the Cost Hint that MySQL Workbench displays (gray box above), advising you that the full table scan on student can be an expensive operation",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Tip 3: Gather object information,,,,,
ms,2,"Next, you’ll want to know as much as possible about the underlying tables in a query",,,,,
ms,2,"Useful information includes table size, whether it’s really a table or just a view, the cardinality of columns in where clauses, and the use of wildcards and scalar functions",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,A quick way to gather that information is the mysqlshow --status command,,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"To review indexes and constraints, run show indexes",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"That shows you which columns are in the index, especially the left leading column in a multi-column index",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"Can the query even use the index? If your query applies functions on an indexed column, the optimizer won’t use the index at all, and you may need to rewrite the query",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"Review the existing keys, constraints and relationships",,,,,
ms,2,"For queries that join many tables, create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that shows you how the tables are related to one another",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Tip 4: Find the driving table,,,,,
ms,2,Your goal in MySQL performance tuning is to drive the query with the table that returns the least data,,,,,
ms,2,"In other words, you compare the number of rows in the final result set to the number of rows the query examined",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Using the driving table reduces the number of logical reads,,,,,
ms,2,"To find the driving table, you study Joins (Right, Left, Outer) and filtering predicates to figure out how to filter as early in the query as possible",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Below is a partial execution plan for a query in a university billing application,,,,,
ms,2,"The red operation shows a high number of rows read (more than 8,700) from the student table",,,,,
ms,2,"In fact, it’s every row in the table, which is inefficient",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Here is a sample query for all students taking a class called “MySQL Performance Tuning”:,,,,,
ms,2,SELECT s,,,,,
ms,2,"fname, s",,,,,
ms,2,"lname, r",,,,,
ms,2,signup_dateFROM student sINNER JOIN registration rON s,,,,,
ms,2,student_id = r,,,,,
ms,2,student_idINNER JOIN class cON r,,,,,
ms,2,class_id = c,,,,,
ms,2,class_idWHERE c,,,,,
ms,2,name,,,,,
ms,2,= 'MYSQL PERFORMANCE TUNING'AND r,,,,,
ms,2,"signup_date BETWEENDATE_SUB(@BillDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY) and @BillDateAND r",,,,,
ms,2,cancelled = 'N';,,,,,
ms,2,"Using SQL diagramming, you determine that class is the driving table",,,,,
ms,2,You run the following SQL to add and view two foreign keys:,,,,,
ms,2,"ALTER TABLE registration ADD FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES student(student_id);ALTER TABLE registration ADD FOREIGN KEY (class_id) REFERENCES class(class_id);SELECT table_name,column_name,constraint_name,referenced_table_name,referenced_column_nameFROM",,,,,
ms,2,information_schema,,,,,
ms,2,key_column_usageWHERE,,,,,
ms,2,table_schema = 'csu' AND table_name = 'registration'AND referenced_column_name IS NOT NULL;,,,,,
ms,2,"With the addition of those foreign key constraints, the optimizer chooses a better execution plan using class as the driving table",,,,,
ms,2,"Although it’s still running that full table scan, several important numbers are improved:",,,,,
ms,2,Before foreign keys,,,,,
ms,2,After foreign keys,,,,,
ms,2,Executions,,,,,
ms,2,28K,,,,,
ms,2,348K,,,,,
ms,2,Average Wait Time,,,,,
ms,2,114 ms,,,,,
ms,2,4 ms,,,,,
ms,2,Rows Examined/Sent,,,,,
ms,2,84K/2,,,,,
ms,2,1.4K/2,,,,,
ms,2,"To send the same number of rows, just 1/60th of the rows (1.4/84) now need to be examined",,,,,
ms,2,"Plus, the ratio of executions to average wait time is vastly improved",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"You may find room for even more improvement, for example, by reviewing your choice of indexes to reduce the number of rows examined",,,,,
ms,2,"In MySQL you can create a covering index, which includes all the columns in the query",,,,,
ms,2,That prevents extra I/O because the index can satisfy the query,,,,,
ms,2,"Or you can create a partial index, say, on a table containing a large varchar column, where the index would be too large to traverse",,,,,
ms,2,"MySQL supports indexes on a virtual column, which works similarly to a function index in Oracle, except that the data is stored only in the index",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"Note, though, that adding indexes doesn’t always improve performance",,,,,
ms,2,"Fortunately, MySQL Workbench makes it easy to capture metrics before and after you experiment so you can see whether and how you’ve improved things",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Tip 5: Identify performance inhibitors,,,,,
ms,2,"Finally, most of the low-hanging fruit of MySQL performance tuning lies in small programming mistakes that have a big impact:",,,,,
ms,2,Cursor or row-by-row processing,,,,,
ms,2,Parallel query processing — Sometimes it’s better to split a complex report into multiple queries and run them in parallel,,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Hard-coded hints allow you to execute the query with the plan that you want to test,,,,,
ms,2,But hints can become stale or forgotten over time,,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,"Wild cards like * may seem handy, but they just generate I/O, add to CPU workload and thrash memory",,,,,
ms,2,"Beware of SELECT * (often used by SQL generators such as EMF, LINQ and NHibernate) and the missing where clause",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Implicit data conversions are a mismatch of datatypes between the column and a parameter,,,,,
ms,2,They impact CPU consumption and can turn off index usage,,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Performance is often hampered by mistakes that database developers introduce when they’re rushing to beat a release deadline and feeling pressure to get new features working,,,,,
ms,2,"Usually, the mistakes are easy to fix, but it does take time and effort to find them",,,,,
ms,2,,,,,,
ms,2,Start tuning the performance of your MySQL databases,,,,,
ms,2,"While the details vary from one database vendor to another, the five main steps of MySQL performance tuning apply:",,,,,
ms,2,Monitor wait time,,,,,
ms,2,Review the execution plan,,,,,
ms,2,Gather object information,,,,,
ms,2,Find the driving table,,,,,
ms,2,Identify performance inhibitors,,,,,
ms,2,"As a MySQL database professional or developer, you’ll find that the methodical approach described here will help you get the most out of this open source database",,,,,

ms,3,"Besides its complexity, tuning is very time-consuming",,,,,
ms,3,"Because when you have a large number of SQL statements to sort through, it brings a bit of uncertainty to find out which statements must you tune up and which one should you leave",,,,,
ms,3,"And while every statement is different, their tuning approach also varies according to their respective functionalities",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,"In this tutorial, I will discuss how to improve MySQL performance using some handy performance tuning tips",,,,,
ms,3,"So, let’s see them in detail below:",,,,,
ms,3,The Benefits of MySQL Performance Tuning,,,,,
ms,3,The major advantage of identifying the performance driving factor for database allows you to avoid over-provisioning and reducing cost by right-sizing your servers,,,,,
ms,3,"It also gives you insights into whether moving data storage or adding server capacity will bring improvement in performance or not, and if so, then how much will it be",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,The tuning database for MySQL query performance optimization doesn’t come with pale challenges,,,,,
ms,3,"However, once tuned properly, the database gives worthwhile performance results with great functionalities",,,,,
ms,3,It not only lowers unwanted task load but also optimizes the MySQL database for faster data retrieval,,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,

ms,3,Optimize Queries With MySQL Query Optimization Guidelines,,,,,
ms,3,Follow these best practices for your MySQL performance tuning and optimizing database speed,,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,"First of all, ensure indexing of all the predicates in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY clauses",,,,,
ms,3,WebSphere Commerce strongly emphasizes on indexing of predicates to augment SQL performance,,,,,
ms,3,"Because improper indexing of SQL queries can cause table scans, which eventually lead up to locking problems and other issues",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,"Therefore, I highly recommend indexing all predicate columns so that database can experience MySQL query optimization",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,You Might Also Like: Laravel Performance Optimization Guide,,,,,
ms,3,Avoid using functions in predicates,,,,,
ms,3,The database doesn’t use an index if it has some function predefined in the column,,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,For example:,,,,,
ms,3,SELECT * FROM TABLE1 WHERE UPPER(COL1)='ABC'CopySELECT * FROM TABLE1 WHERE UPPER(COL1)='ABC'CopySELECT * FROM TABLE1 WHERE UPPER(COL1)='ABC'Copy,,,,,
ms,3,"Because of the UPPER() function, the database doesn’t utilize the index on COL1",,,,,
ms,3,"If there isn’t any way to avoid that function in SQL, you will have to create a new function-based index or have to generate custom columns in the database to improve performance",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,Avoid using a wildcard (%) at the beginning of a predicate,,,,,
ms,3,The predicate LIKE '%abc' causes a full table scan,,,,,
ms,3,For example:,,,,,
ms,3,SELECT * FROM TABLE1 WHERE COL1 LIKE '%ABC'CopySELECT * FROM TABLE1 WHERE COL1 LIKE '%ABC'CopySELECT * FROM TABLE1 WHERE COL1 LIKE '%ABC'Copy,,,,,
ms,3,"In most cases, this wildcard usage brings major performance limitations",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,Avoid unnecessary columns in SELECT clause,,,,,
ms,3,"Instead of using ‘SELECT *’, always specify columns in the SELECT clause to improve MySQL performance",,,,,
ms,3,"Because unnecessary columns cause additional load on the database, slowing down its performance as well whole systematic process",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,"Use inner join, instead of outer join if possible",,,,,
ms,3,Use outer join only when it is necessary,,,,,
ms,3,"Using it needlessly not only limits database performance but also limits MySQL query optimization options, resulting in slower execution of SQL statements",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,Use DISTINCT and UNION only if it is necessary,,,,,
ms,3,Using UNION and DISTINCT operators without any major purpose causes unwanted sorting and slowing down of SQL execution,,,,,
ms,3,"Instead of UNION, using UNION ALL brings more efficiency in the process and improves MySQL performance more precisely",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,The ORDER BY clause is mandatory in SQL if you expect to get a sorted result,,,,,
ms,3,The ORDER BY keyword sorts the result-set in predefined statement columns,,,,,
ms,3,"Though the statement brings advantage for the database admins for getting the sorted data, it also produces a bit performance impact in the SQL execution",,,,,
ms,3,"Because the query first needs to sort the data for producing the final result-set, causing a bit complex operation in the SQL execution",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,

ms,3,Don’t Use MySQL as a Queue,,,,,
ms,3,Queues can affect your database performance right from the core and could enter in your app databases without your knowledge,,,,,
ms,3,"For instance, if you are setting up a status for a particular item so that a ‘relevant process’ can access it, you are unintentionally creating a queue",,,,,
ms,3,What it does is that it builds up extra load time to access the resource without any major reason,,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,

ms,3,"At Cloudways you can avail the Utilities like Memcache, Supervisord, and Redis to optimize your database",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,Check Now,,,,,
ms,3,Queues cause problems for two major reasons,,,,,
ms,3,"They serialize your workload, preventing completion of tasks in parallel, and they often result in a table that contains work in process as well as historical data from already completed jobs",,,,,
ms,3,It not only adds latency to the application but also adds hindrance to the MySQL performance tuning,,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,

ms,3,Understand the Four Fundamental Resources,,,,,
ms,3,You need four fundamental resources to make database functions,,,,,
ms,3,"CPU, disk, memory, and network",,,,,
ms,3,"If anyone of these doesn’t function correctly, it ultimately affects the database server and results in poor performance",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,"To understand the fundamental resources properly, you need to focus on two particular areas i",,,,,
ms,3,e choosing the right hardware and troubleshooting problems with it,,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,Always ensure to use all-round performance components when choosing hardware for the MySQL database,,,,,
ms,3,Not only opt for the best among the stack but also make sure that there should be the right balance between them,,,,,
ms,3,"We have often seen that organizations tend to select servers with fast CPUs and large disks, but they get mistaken with starved memory which eventually kills performance",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,"In some scenarios, adding memory becomes highly substantial for improving performance when it comes to the magnitude",,,,,
ms,3,"It does look a bit counterintuitive, but in most cases, the overutilization of disks affects directly to the database performance",,,,,
ms,3,As the deficiency of enough memory to hold the server’s data proves costly in derailing database performance,,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,"When it comes to troubleshooting, always keep in check the performance of all four fundamental resources",,,,,
ms,3,Validate qualitatively that they are performing as per the needs improvement in the norms,,,,,
ms,3,Taking this audit into regular consideration will quickly solve major occurring problems,,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,Pagination Queries,,,,,
ms,3,Applications that paginate tend to bring the server down,,,,,
ms,3,"In showing you a page of results, with a link to go to the next page, these applications typically group and sort in ways that can’t use indexes, and they employ a LIMIT and offset function that causes the server to do a lot of work generating, then discarding rows",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,You can find optimizations within the user interface itself,,,,,
ms,3,"Instead of showing the exact number of pages in the results and links to an individual page, you can just show a link to the next page",,,,,
ms,3,You can also prevent people from going to irrelevant pages,,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,"On the query side, instead of using LIMIT with offset, you can select one more row than you need, and when the user clicks the “next page” link, you can designate that final row as the starting point for the next set of results",,,,,
ms,3,"For example, if the user has viewed a page with rows 101 through 120, you will have to select row 121 as well; to render the next page, you’d query the server for rows greater than or equal to 121, limit 21",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,Optimizing MySQL Subqueries,,,,,
ms,3,"The most important advice I can give you about subqueries is that you must prefer a join where possible, at least in current versions of MySQL",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,"Subqueries are the subject of intense work by the optimizer team, and upcoming versions of MySQL may have more subquery optimizations",,,,,
ms,3,"Do keep a check on which of the optimizations will end up in released code, and how much difference they’ll make",,,,,
ms,3,My point here is that “prefer a join” is not future-proof advice,,,,,
ms,3,"The server is getting smarter all the time, and the cases where you have to tell it how to do something instead of what results to return are becoming fewer",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,Mysql Query Cache,,,,,
ms,3,One of the most important aspects of measuring performance is caching the content,,,,,
ms,3,MySQL provides database query caching which caches the SELECT statement text and the retrieved result,,,,,
ms,3,"Hence, whenever you make a duplicate database, you call MySQL query cache, it will respond to you and show the result from the cache, and no call will be parsed repeatedly",,,,,
ms,3,"In this way, you can maximize the MySQL cache optimization process",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,"To set up MySQL query cache, you must add a few settings to MySQL",,,,,
ms,3,"First of all, you must check if query cache is available or not with the following command:",,,,,
ms,3,mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_query_cache';mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_query_cache';mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_query_cache';,,,,,
ms,3,"This will show the result, YES",,,,,
ms,3,This means MySQL cache is working fine,,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,+------------------+-------+,,,,,
ms,3,| Variable_name    | Value |,,,,,
ms,3,+------------------+-------+,,,,,
ms,3,| have_query_cache | YES   |,,,,,
ms,3,+------------------+-------++------------------+-------+| Variable_name,,,,,
ms,3,| Value |+------------------+-------+| have_query_cache | YES,,,,,
ms,3,|+------------------+-------++------------------+-------+,,,,,
ms,3,| Variable_name,,,,,
ms,3,| Value |,,,,,
ms,3,+------------------+-------+,,,,,
ms,3,| have_query_cache | YES,,,,,
ms,3,|,,,,,
ms,3,+------------------+-------+,,,,,
ms,3,"Now, you can set up the MySQL query cache size and type",,,,,
ms,3,Remember the minimum default size is 40KB,,,,,
ms,3,The maximum size can be 32MB,,,,,
ms,3,You can set up the MySQL query_cache_size by using the following command:,,,,,
ms,3,mysql> SET GLOBAL query_cache_size = 40000;mysql> SET GLOBAL query_cache_size = 40000;mysql> SET GLOBAL query_cache_size = 40000;,,,,,
ms,3,Query cache type can determine the behavior of all connections,,,,,
ms,3,You can also disable the Query cache for queries like:,,,,,
ms,3,mysql> SET SESSION query_cache_type = OFF;mysql> SET SESSION query_cache_type = OFF;mysql> SET SESSION query_cache_type = OFF;,,,,,
ms,3,"You can also set values like 0,1 and 2 for setting up the connection status",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,Use Memcached for MySQL Caching,,,,,
ms,3,Memcached is a distributed memory caching system,,,,,
ms,3,"It speeds up websites having large dynamic databases by storing database object in Dynamic Memory to reduce the pressure on a server, whenever an external data source requests a read",,,,,
ms,3,A Memcached layer reduces the number of times the database makes a request,,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,"Memcached stores the values (v) with the key (k), and retrieves the values (v) with the key (k) without even parsing the database queries and stays away from all these hassles",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,"To read more about Memcached, you can read the guide on how to set up Memcache in php",,,,,
ms,3,,,,,,
ms,3,Wrapping up!,,,,,
ms,3,"This article provides in detail, the account of the best practices for database optimization and handy MySQL performance tuning tips every developer must know",,,,,
ms,3,"It’s a complete guide for those backend devs, who are uncertain about their poor database performance and need some handy techniques to optimize MySQL database from the core",,,,,

ms,4,MySQL Server Configuration,,,,,
ms,4,IntroductionMySQL is a popular open-source database application that stores and structures data in a way that is meaningful and readily accessible,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,"With large applications, the sheer amount of data can lead to performance problems",,,,,
ms,4,This guide provides several tuning tips on how to improve the performance of a MySQL database,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,Prerequisites,,,,,
ms,4,"A Linux system with MySQL installed and running, Centos or Ubuntu",,,,,
ms,4,An existing database,,,,,
ms,4,Administrator credentials for the operating system and the database,,,,,
ms,4,"System Performance Tuning for MySQLAt the system level, you’ll adjust hardware and software options to improve MySQL performance",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,1,,,,,
ms,4,Balance the Four Main Hardware Resources,,,,,
ms,4,StorageTake a moment to evaluate your storage,,,,,
ms,4,"If you’re using traditional hard disk drives (HDD), you can upgrade to solid-state drives (SSD) for a performance improvement",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,Use a tool like iotop or sar from the sysstat package to monitor your disk input/output rates,,,,,
ms,4,"If disk usage is much higher than usage of other resources, consider adding more storage or upgrading to faster storage",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,ProcessorProcessors are usually considered the measure of how fast your system is,,,,,
ms,4,Use the Linux top command for a breakdown of how your resources are used,,,,,
ms,4,Pay attention to the MySQL processes and the percentage of processor usage they require,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,"Processors are more expensive to upgrade, but if your CPU is a bottleneck, an upgrade might be necessary",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,MemoryMemory represents the total amount of RAM in your MySQL server,,,,,
ms,4,You can adjust the memory cache (more on that later) to improve performance,,,,,
ms,4,"If you don’t have enough memory, or if the existing memory isn’t optimized, you can end up damaging your performance instead of improving it",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,"Like other bottlenecks, if your server is constantly running out of memory, you can upgrade by adding more",,,,,
ms,4,"If you run short of memory, your server will cache data storage (like a hard drive) to act as memory",,,,,
ms,4,Database caching slows down your performance,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,NetworkIt’s important to monitor network traffic to make sure you have sufficient infrastructure to manage the load,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,"Overloading your network can lead to latency, dropped packets, and even server outages",,,,,
ms,4,Make sure you have enough network bandwidth to accommodate your normal levels of database traffic,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,2,,,,,
ms,4,"Use InnoDB, Not MyISAMMyISAM is an older database style used for some MySQL databases",,,,,
ms,4,It is a less efficient database design,,,,,
ms,4,The newer InnoDB supports more advanced features and has in-built optimization mechanics,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,"InnoDB uses a clustered index and keeps data in pages, which are stored in consecutive physical blocks",,,,,
ms,4,"If a value is too large for a page, InnoDB moves it to another location, then indexes the value",,,,,
ms,4,"This feature helps keep relevant data in the same place on the storage device, meaning it takes the physical hard drive less time to access the data",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,3,,,,,
ms,4,Use the Latest Version of MySQLUsing the latest version is not always feasible for older and legacy databases,,,,,
ms,4,"But whenever possible, you should check the version of MySQL in use and upgrade to the latest",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,A part of the ongoing development includes performance enhancements,,,,,
ms,4,Some common performance adjustments may be rendered obsolete by newer versions of MySQL,,,,,
ms,4,"In general, it’s always better to use native MySQL performance enhancement over scripting and configuration files",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,"Software Performance TuningThese methods involve tweaking the MySQL configuration files, writing more efficient database queries, and structuring the database to retrieve data more efficiently",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,"Note: When adjusting configuration settings, it's best to make small incremental adjustments",,,,,
ms,4,A major adjustment may overburden another value and degrade performance,,,,,
ms,4,"Also, it is recommended that you make one change at a time and then test",,,,,
ms,4,It’s easier to track errors or misconfigurations when you only change one variable at a time,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,4,,,,,
ms,4,"Consider Using an Automatic Performance Improvement ToolAs with most software, not all tools work on all versions of MySQL",,,,,
ms,4,We will examine three utilities to evaluate your MySQL database and recommend changes to improve performance,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,The first is tuning-primer,,,,,
ms,4,"This tool is a bit older, designed for MySQL 5.5 – 5.7",,,,,
ms,4,It can analyze your database and suggest settings to improve performance,,,,,
ms,4,"For example, it may suggest that you raise the query_cache_size parameter if it feels like your system can’t process queries quickly enough to keep the cache clear",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,"The second tuning tool, useful for most modern MySQL databases, is MySQLTuner",,,,,
ms,4,This script (mysqltuner,,,,,
ms,4,pl) is written in Perl,,,,,
ms,4,"Like tuning-primer, it analyzes your database configuration looking for bottlenecks and inefficiencies",,,,,
ms,4,The output shows metrics and recommendations:,,,,,
ms,4,"At the top of the output, you can see the version of the MySQLTuner tool and your database",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,The script works with MySQL 8,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,"Log file recommendations are the first on the list, but if you scroll to the bottom, you can see general recommendations for improving MySQL performance",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,"The third utility, which you may already have, is the phpMyAdmin Advisor",,,,,
ms,4,"Like the other two utilities, it evaluates your database and recommends adjustments",,,,,
ms,4,"If you’re already using phpMyAdmin, the Advisor is a helpful tool you can use within the GUI",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,5,,,,,
ms,4,Optimize QueriesA query is a coded request to search the database for data that matches a certain value,,,,,
ms,4,"There are some query operators that, by their very nature, take a long time to run",,,,,
ms,4,"If your environment relies on automated queries, they may be impacting performance",,,,,
ms,4,Check and terminate MySQL processes that may pile up in time,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,6,,,,,
ms,4,Use Indexes Where AppropriateMany database queries use a structure similar to this:,,,,,
ms,4,SELECT … WHERE,,,,,
ms,4,"These queries involve evaluating, filtering, and retrieving results",,,,,
ms,4,You can restructure these by adding a small set of indexes for the related tables,,,,,
ms,4,The query can be directed at the index to speed up the query,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,7,,,,,
ms,4,Functions in PredicatesAvoid using a function in the predicate of a query,,,,,
ms,4,For example:,,,,,
ms,4,SELECT * FROM MYTABLE WHERE UPPER(COL1)='123'Copy,,,,,
ms,4,"The UPPER notation creates a function, which has to operate during the SELECT operation",,,,,
ms,4,"This doubles the work the query is doing, and you should avoid it if possible",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,8,,,,,
ms,4,Avoid % Wildcard in a PredicateThe wildcard % stands for zero or more characters,,,,,
ms,4,If your query looks like this:,,,,,
ms,4,SELECT * FROM MYTABLE WHERE COL1 LIKE '%123'Copy,,,,,
ms,4,The expression ‘%123’ includes all values that end with 123,,,,,
ms,4,"The % sign stands for any type or number of characters preceding, including no characters",,,,,
ms,4,The query must now perform a full table scan to test for this condition,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,9,,,,,
ms,4,Specify Columns in SELECT FunctionA common expression is to use SELECT * to scan all of the database columns,,,,,
ms,4,"If you specify the columns you need, your query won’t need to scan irrelevant columns",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,10,,,,,
ms,4,Use ORDER BY AppropriatelyThe ORDER BY expression sorts results by the specified column,,,,,
ms,4,It can be used to sort by two columns at once,,,,,
ms,4,"These should be sorted in the same order, ascending or descending",,,,,
ms,4,"If you try to sort different columns in different order, it will slow down performance",,,,,
ms,4,You may combine this with an index to speed up the sorting,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,11,,,,,
ms,4,"JOIN, UNION, DISTINCTTry to use an inner join whenever possible",,,,,
ms,4,An outer join looks at additional data outside the specified columns,,,,,
ms,4,"That’s fine if you need that data, but it’s a waste of performance to include data that won’t be required",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,The UNION and DISTINCT commands are sometimes included in queries,,,,,
ms,4,"Like an outer join, it’s fine to use these expressions if they are necessary",,,,,
ms,4,"However, they add additional sorting and reading of the database",,,,,
ms,4,"If you don’t need them, it’s better to find a more efficient expression",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,12,,,,,
ms,4,Use the EXPLAIN FunctionModern MySQL databases include an EXPLAIN function,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,Appending the EXPLAIN expression to the beginning of a query will read and evaluate the query,,,,,
ms,4,"If there are inefficient expressions or confusing structures, EXPLAIN can help you find them",,,,,
ms,4,You can then adjust the phrasing of your query to avoid unintentional table scans or other performance hits,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,13,,,,,
ms,4,MySQL Server ConfigurationThis configuration involves making changes to your /etc/mysql/my,,,,,
ms,4,cnf file,,,,,
ms,4,Proceed with caution and make minor changes at a time,,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,query_cache_size – Specifies the size of the cache of MySQL queries waiting to run,,,,,
ms,4,The recommendation is to start with small values around 10MB and then increase to no more than 100-200MB,1,4553,query_cache_size,P <= 200MB,
ms,4,"With too many cached queries, you can experience a cascade of queries “Waiting for cache lock",,,,,
ms,4,"If your queries keep backing up, a better procedure is to use EXPLAIN to evaluate each query and find ways to make them more efficient",,,,,
ms,4,,,,,,
ms,4,max_connection – Refers to the number of connections allowed into the database,,,,,
ms,4,"If you’re getting errors citing “Too many connections,” increasing this value may help",,,,,

ms,6,"3 CommentsWhile there is no magic bullet for MySQL tuning, there are a few areas that can be focused on upfront that can dramatically improve the performance of your MySQL installation",,,,,
ms,6,"While much information has been published on this topic over the years, I wanted to break down some of the more critical settings that anyone can implement with no guesswork required",,,,,
ms,6,"Depending on the version of MySQL you are running, some of the default values used in this post may differ from your install, but the premise is still largely the same",,,,,
ms,6,"Initial MySQL performance tuning can be broken down to the following categories:Tuning for your hardwareTuning for best performance / best practicesTuning for your workloadTuning MySQL for Your HardwareDepending on the hardware you have installed MySQL on, some variables need to be set based on the machine (or VM) specifications",,,,,
ms,6,"The following variables are largely dependent on your hardware:innodb_buffer_pool_sizeGenerally, set to 50% – 70% of your total RAM as a starting point",1,,innodb_buffer_pool_size;innodb_buffer_pool_size,P >= 0.5 * memory; P <= 0.7 * memory,
ms,6,It does not need to be set any larger than the total database size,,,,,
ms,6,"Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) can offer additional insight, showing your buffer pool usage and allowing you to tune accordingly",,,,,
ms,6,innodb_log_file_sizeThis is generally set between 128M – 2G,1,,innodb_log_file_size,P >= 128M; P <= 2G,
ms,6,Should be large enough to hold at most an hour or so of logs,,,,,
ms,6,This is more than enough so that MySQL can reorder writes to use sequential I/O during the flushing and checkpointing processes,,,,,
ms,6,"PMM can offer additional insight, as if you are using more than 50% of your log space, you may benefit from a log file size increase",,,,,
ms,6,innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commitSetting to “1” (default in 5.7) gives the most durability,,,,,
ms,6,"Setting to “0” or “2” will give more performance, but less durability",1,4913,innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit,"P in {0, 2}",
ms,6,innodb_flush_methodSetting this to O_DIRECT will avoid a performance penalty from double buffering,,,,,
ms,6,MySQL Tuning for Best Performance/Best Practicesinnodb_file_per_tableSetting this to “ON” will generate an independent InnoDB table space for every table in the database,,,,,
ms,6,innodb_stats_on_metadataSetting this to “OFF” avoids unnecessary updating of InnoDB statistics and can greatly improve read speeds,1,,innodb_stats_on_metadata,P = off,
ms,6,"innodb_buffer_pool_instancesA best practice is to set this to “8” unless the buffer pool size is < 1G, in which case set to “1”",1,,innodb_buffer_pool_instances;innodb_buffer_pool_instances,P = 8; P = 1,Pool size >= 1G;Pool size < 1G
ms,6,uery_cache_type & query_cache_sizeSetting both of these to “0” will entirely disable the query cache,,,,,
ms,6,"Tuning for Your WorkloadTo tune further, more information will be required",,,,,
ms,6,The best way to gather this information is to install a MySQL monitoring / graphing tool like Percona Monitoring and Management platform,,,,,
ms,6,"Once you have a tool installed, we can dive into the individual metrics and start customizing based on the data",,,,,
ms,6,I would recommend starting with one of the most impactful variables – the innodb_buffer_pool_size,,,,,
ms,6,Compare the RAM and number of free pages on your instance to the total buffer pool size,,,,,
ms,6,"Based on these metrics, you can determine if you need to increase or decrease your overall buffer pool size setting",,,,,
ms,6,"Next, take a look at your metrics for the InnoDB Log File usage",,,,,
ms,6,The rule of thumb is that your log files should hold approximately one hour of data,,,,,
ms,6,"If you see that your data written to the log files hourly exceeds the total size of the log files, you would want to increase the innodb_log_file_size variable and restart MySQL",,,,,
ms,6,You could also verify with “SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;” via the MySQL CLI to assist in calculating a good InnoDB log file size,,,,,
ms,6,Other SettingsOther InnoDB settings that can be further tuned for better performance are:innodb_autoinc_lock_modeSetting this to “2” (interleaved mode) can remove the need for an auto-inc lock (at the table level) and can increase performance when using multi-row insert statements to insert values into a table with an auto increment primary key,1,,innodb_autoinc_lock_mode,P = 2,
ms,6,Note that this requires either ROW or MIXED binlog format,,,,,
ms,6,innodb_io_capacity / innodb_io_capacity_maxThese settings will impact your database if you are utilizing a write-heavy workflow,,,,,
ms,6,This does not apply to read (SELECT) traffic,,,,,
ms,6,"To tune these values, it is best to know how many iops your system can perform",,,,,
ms,6,It is a good idea to run sysbench or another benchmark tool to determine your storage throughput,,,,,
ms,6,"PMM can offer additional insight, showing your IO usage and allowing you to tune accordingly",,,,,
ms,6,"In SummaryWhile this is by no means a comprehensive article on MySQL tuning, the suggestions above should clear some of the low hanging fruit and get your system closer to an ideal setup",,,,,
ms,6,"As with all database tuning, your process should be an ongoing one based on current information",,,,,
ms,6,"Examine the settings proposed above, and implement if they make sense for your environment/workload",,,,,

ms,6,Impact of innodb_stats_on_metadata was completely new to me,,,,,
ms,6,"We also evaluated innodb_io_capacity and innodb_read_ahead_threshold at various settings, no measurable benefit for query workloads that I could find either",,,,,

ms,6,innodb_buffer_pool_instances (change from 8 to 32) innodb_read_io_threads (change from 4 to 16)Under a 100% physical I/O workload this resulted in a 4x speedup,,,,,

ms,6,Brian Sumpter,,,,,
ms,6,Reply,,,,,
ms,6,Hi Jie Zhou,,,,,
ms,6,The MySQL default is to set innodb_buffer_pool_instances to 8 (in MySQL version 5.7 and up) as this is a good starting point for most general use cases,,,,,
ms,6,"As per the MySQL documentation, this option takes effect only when you set innodb_buffer_pool_size to a size of 1GB or more",,,,,
ms,6,The total size you specify is divided among all the buffer pools,,,,,
ms,6,"For best efficiency, specify a combination of innodb_buffer_pool_instances and innodb_buffer_pool_size so that each buffer pool instance is at least 1GB",,,,,

ms,7,This can vary greatly case by case as there’s very little no one-size-fits-all advice,,,,,
ms,7,"Therefore, also included below the tips, are additional links to popular free MySQL tuning scripts and tools",,,,,
ms,7,"Stay up to date with the latest MySQL server versionsWith each new version of MySQL released, there’s substantial performance and feature enhancements over previous versions",,,,,
ms,7,"So the most important advice would be to upgrade, upgrade, upgrade",,,,,
ms,7,Have a look at some version performance comparisons here,,,,,
ms,7,"If you are seeking additional features or flexibility you may already be using MariaDB, or Percona, which are enhanced drop-in replacements for MySQL Server",,,,,
ms,7,If you’ve seen notable improvements in using MariaDB or Percona over stock MySQL please share your experience below,,,,,
ms,7,They are both great options,,,,,
ms,7,"MySQL Performance Tuning AdviceBefore continuing please have a look at the following MySQL performance tuning articles: MySQL Database Performance: Avoid this common mistake and note that due to the limitations of MySQL query cache, it has been deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.20 and is removed in MySQL 8.0",,,,,
ms,7,"ther than the tuning scripts listed below, try to avoid online advice unless its via mysql",,,,,
ms,7,"com or those that reference directly MySQL, Pecona’s, or MariaDB articles or documentation",,,,,
ms,7,You will notice that both of the above blog posts reference or quote MySQL’s docs,,,,,
ms,7,There’s a ton of conflicting advice and opinions online,,,,,
ms,7,"As such, my advice is to always crosscheck your config changes with official documentation",,,,,
ms,7,This includes everything I say here,,,,,
ms,7,"In fact, when venturing to change MySQL’s defaults, unless you have a basis for changes, its best to leave it as is",,,,,
ms,7,When there’s doubt… stick with the defaults,,,,,
ms,7,"Always, base your changes on benchmarks, comparisons, and time-tested firsthand data",,,,,
ms,7,"Selecting MySQL Storage EngineThis is simple, use InnoDB and avoid MyISAM when possible",,,,,
ms,7,For these reasons:Versions of MySQL 5.5 and greater have switched to the InnoDB engine to ensure referential integrity constraints and higher concurrency,,,,,
ms,7,InnoDB has better crash recovery,,,,,
ms,7,"InnoDB has row-level locking, MyISAM can only do full table-level locking",,,,,
ms,7,"Like MyISAM, InnoDB now has FULLTEXT search indexes as of MySQL 5.6InnoDB supports transactions, foreign keys and relationship constraints, MyISAM does not",,,,,
ms,7,MySQL Performance Tuning ScriptsYou cannot replace Professional MySQL tuning with scripts,,,,,
ms,7,"Scripts serve as basic guides, sometimes spot-on, but most times loose guides which will only solve the most grievous misconfigured parameters",,,,,
ms,7,Use them as a starting point,,,,,
ms,7,"Meaning, before you contact a professional to tune MySQL use these tuning scripts so that at the very least you don’t have any so-called embarrassing config in your my",,,,,
ms,7,cnf file,,,,,
ms,7,"For example, join_buffer_size set to 4GB when the total DB size is less than 1GB",1,,join_buffer_size,P != 4GB,Dbsize < 1GB
ms,7,"Now, let’s look at popular scripts and tools available for MySQL performance tuning: MySqlTuner, Tuning-Primer, MySQLreport, Percona Toolkit, and phpMyAdmin Advisor",,,,,
ms,7,MySQLTunerA script thas is written in Perl that will assist you with your MySQL configuration and make recommendations for increased performance and stability,,,,,
ms,7,"MySQLTuner is maintained and indicator collect is increasing week after week supporting a lot of configurations such as Galera Cluster, TokuDB, Performance schema, Linux OS metrics, InnoDB, MyISAM, Aria, etc",,,,,
ms,7,– MySQLTuner on Github,,,,,
ms,7,Tuning-PrimerThis script takes information from “SHOW STATUS LIKE…” and “SHOW VARIABLES LIKE…” to produce sane recommendations for tuning server variables,,,,,
ms,7,It is compatible with all versions of MySQL 3.23 and higher (including 5.1),,,,,
ms,7,he original script is no longer updated,,,,,
ms,7,I’ve been using this Tuning-primer version on Github which fully supports MariaDB,,,,,
ms,7,"Percona ToolkitPercona Toolkit is a collection of advanced open-source command-line tools, developed to perform a variety of MySQL tasks that are too difficult or complex to perform manually – freeing your DBAs for work that helps you achieve your business goals",,,,,
ms,7,"Useful tools include: pt-align, pt-archiver, pt-config-diff, pt-deadlock-logger, pt-diskstats, pt-duplicate-key-checker, pt-fifo-split, pt-find, pt-fingerprint, pt-fk-error-logger, pt-heartbeat, pt-index-usage, pt-ioprofile, pt-kill, pt-mext, pt-mongodb-query-digest, pt-mongodb-summary, pt-mysql-summary, pt-online-schema-change, pt-pg-summary, pt-pmp, pt-query-digest, pt-secure-collect, pt-show-grants, pt-sift, pt-slave-delay, pt-slave-find, pt-slave-restart, pt-stalk, pt-summary, pt-table-checksum, pt-table-sync, pt-table-usage, pt-upgrade, pt-variable-advisor and pt-visual-explain",,,,,

ms,8,"insight for DBAs, Monitoring, MySQL, Percona Software",,,,,
ms,8,"0 CommentsWhile there is no magic bullet for MySQL 5.7 database tuning, there are a few areas that can be focused on upfront that can dramatically improve the performance of your MySQL installation",,,,,
ms,8,"While much information has been published on this topic over the years, I wanted to break down some of the more critical settings that anyone can implement – with no guesswork required",,,,,
ms,8,"Depending on the version of MySQL you are running, some of the default values used in this post may differ from your install, but the premise is still largely the same",,,,,
ms,8,We will focus on MySQL 5.7 for the purposes of this article,,,,,
ms,8,"Initial MySQL performance tuning can be broken down to the following categories:Tuning for your hardwareTuning for best performance/best practicesTuning for your workloadMySQL 5.7 Database TuningTuning For Your HardwareDepending on the hardware you have installed MySQL on, some variables need to be set based on the machine (or VM) specifications",,,,,
ms,8,"The following variables are largely dependent on your hardware:innodb_buffer_pool_sizeGenerally, set to 50% – 70% of your total RAM as a starting point",1,,innodb_buffer_pool_size;innodb_buffer_pool_size,P >= 0.5 * memory; P <= 0.7 * memory,
ms,8,It does not need to be set any larger than the total database size,,,,,
ms,8,innodb_log_file_sizeThis is generally set between 128M – 2G,1,,innodb_log_file_size;innodb_log_file_size,P >= 128M; P <= 2G,
ms,8,It does not need to be any larger than the buffer pool,,,,,
ms,8,innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commitSetting to “1” (default in 5.7) gives the most durability,,,,,
ms,8,"Setting to “0” or “2” will give more performance, but less durability",1,5126,innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit,"P in {0, 2}",
ms,8,innodb_flush_methodSetting this to O_DIRECT will avoid the performance penalty from double buffering,1,,innodb_flush_method,P = O_DIRECT,
ms,8,Tuning For Best Performance / Best Practicesinnodb_file_per_tableSetting this to “ON” will generate an independent InnoDB table space for every table in the database,,,,,
ms,8,innodb_stats_on_metadataSetting this to “OFF” avoids unnecessary updating of InnoDB statistics and can greatly improve read speeds,1,,innodb_stats_on_metadata,P = off,
ms,8,"innodb_buffer_pool_instancesA best practice is to set this to “8” unless the buffer pool size is < 1G, in which case set to “1”",1,,innodb_buffer_pool_instances;innodb_buffer_pool_instances,P = 8; P = 1,Pool size >= 1G; Pool size < 1G
ms,8,uery_cache_type & query_cache_sizeSetting both of these to “0” will entirely disable the query cache,,,,,
ms,8,"Tuning For Your WorkloadTo tune further, more information will be required",,,,,
ms,8,The best way to gather this information is to install a MySQL monitoring/graphing tool like Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM),,,,,
ms,8,"Once you have a tool installed, we can dive into the individual metrics and start customizing based on the data",,,,,
ms,8,I would recommend starting with one of the most impactful variables – the innodb_buffer_pool_size,,,,,
ms,8,Compare the RAM and number of free pages on your instance to the total buffer pool size,,,,,
ms,8,"Based on these metrics, you can determine if you need to increase or decrease your overall buffer pool size setting",,,,,
ms,8,"Next, take a look at your metrics for the InnoDB Log File usage",,,,,
ms,8,The rule of thumb is that your log files should hold approximately one hour of data,,,,,
ms,8,"If you see that the data written to the log files hourly exceeds the total size of the log files, you would want to increase the innodb_log_file_size variable and restart MySQL",,,,,
ms,8,You could also verify with “SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;” via the MySQL CLI to assist in calculating a good InnoDB log file size,,,,,
ms,8,"In SummaryWhile this is by no means a comprehensive article on MySQL 5.7 database tuning, the suggestions above should clear some of the low hanging fruit and get your system closer to an ideal setup",,,,,
ms,8,"As with all database tuning, your process should be an ongoing one based on current information",,,,,
ms,8,"Examine the settings proposed above, and implement if they make sense for your environment/workload",,,,,
ms,8,Install a good monitoring tool to give insight into the database (Percona Monitoring and Management is our suggestion),,,,,
ms,8,tay current on your monitoring graphs to determine other areas where you may need to tune,,,,,

ms,9,Performance Management,,,,,
ms,9,MySQL,,,,,
ms,9,MySQL is extensive and has lots of areas to optimize and tweak for the desired performance,,,,,
ms,9,"Some changes can be performed dynamically, others require a server restart",,,,,
ms,9,"It is pretty common to find a MySQL installation with a default configuration, although the latter may not be appropriate per se from your workload and setup",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,"Here are the key areas in MySQL which I have taken from different expert sources in the MySQL world, as well as our own experiences here at Severalnines",,,,,
ms,9,This blog would serve as your cheat sheet to tune performance and make your MySQL great again :-),,,,,
ms,9,Let’s take a look on these by outlining the key areas in MySQL,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,System Variables,,,,,
ms,9,MySQL has lots of variables that you can consider to change,,,,,
ms,9,Some variables are dynamic which means they can be set using the SET statement,,,,,
ms,9,"Others require a server restart, after they are set in the configuration file (e",,,,,
ms,9,g,,,,,
ms,9,/etc/my,,,,,
ms,9,"cnf, etc/mysql/my",,,,,
ms,9,cnf),,,,,
ms,9,"However, I’ll go over the common things that are pretty common to tune to make the server optimized",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,sort_buffer_size,,,,,
ms,9,"This variable controls how large your filesort buffer is, which means that whenever a query needs to sort the rows, the value of this variable is used to limit the size that needs to be allocated",,,,,
ms,9,"Take note that this variable is per-query that is processed (or per-connection) basis, which means that it would be a memory hungry when you set this higher and if you have multiple connections that requires sorting of your rows",,,,,
ms,9,"However, you can monitor your needs by checking the global status variable Sort_merge_passes",,,,,
ms,9,"If this value is large, you should consider increasing the value of the sort_buffer_size system variable",,,,,
ms,9,"Otherwise, take it to the moderate limit that you need",,,,,
ms,9,"If you set this too low or if you have large queries to process, the effect of sorting your rows can be slower than expected because data is retrieved randomly doing disk dives",,,,,
ms,9,This can cause performance degradation,,,,,
ms,9,"However, it is best to fix your queries",,,,,
ms,9,"Otherwise, if your application is designed to pull large queries and requires sorting, then it is efficient to use tools that handles query caching like Redis",,,,,
ms,9,"By default, in MySQL 8.0, the current value set is 256 KiB",,,,,
ms,9,Set this accordingly only when you have queries that are heavily using or calling sorts,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,read_buffer_size,,,,,
ms,9,"MySQL documentation mentions that for each request that performs a sequential scan of a table, it allocates a read buffer",,,,,
ms,9,The read_buffer_size system variable determines the buffer size,,,,,
ms,9,"It is also useful for MyISAM, but this variable affects all storage engines as well",,,,,
ms,9,"For MEMORY tables, it is use to determine the memory block size",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,"Basically, each thread that does a sequential scan for a MyISAM table allocates a buffer of this size (in bytes) for each table it scans",,,,,
ms,9,"It does applies for all storage engines (that includes InnoDB) as well, so it’s helpful for queries that are sorting rows using ORDER BY and caching its indexes in a temporary file",,,,,
ms,9,"If you do many sequential scans, bulk insert into partition tables, caching results of nested queries, then consider increasing its value",,,,,
ms,9,The value of this variable should be a multiple of 4KB,,,,,
ms,9,"If it is set to a value that is not a multiple of 4KB, its value will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of 4KB",,,,,
ms,9,Take into account that setting this to a higher value will consume a large chunk of your server’s memory,,,,,
ms,9,I suggest not to use this without proper benchmarking and monitoring of your environment,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,read_rnd_buffer_size,,,,,
ms,9,"This variable deals with reading rows from a MyISAM table in sorted order following a key-sorting operation, the rows are read through this buffer to avoid disk seeks",,,,,
ms,9,"The documentation says, when reading rows in an arbitrary sequence or from a MyISAM table in sorted order following a key-sorting operation, the rows are read through this buffer (and determined through this buffer size) to avoid disk seeks",,,,,
ms,9,Setting the variable to a large value can improve ORDER BY performance by quite a lot,,,,,
ms,9,"However, this is a buffer allocated for each client, so you should not set the global variable to a large value",,,,,
ms,9,"Instead, change the session variable only from within those clients that need to run large queries",,,,,
ms,9,"However, you should take into account that this does not apply to MariaDB, especially when taking advantage of MRR",,,,,
ms,9,MariaDB uses mrr_buffer_size while MySQL uses read_buffer_size read_rnd_buffer_size,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,join_buffer_size,,,,,
ms,9,"By default, value is of 256K",,,,,
ms,9,"The minimum size of the buffer that is used for plain index scans, range index scans, and joins that do not use indexes and thus perform full table scans",,,,,
ms,9,Also used by the BKA optimization (which is disabled by default),,,,,
ms,9,Increase its value to get faster full joins when adding indexes is not possible,,,,,
ms,9,Caveat though might be memory issues if you set this too high,,,,,
ms,9,Remember that one join buffer is allocated for each full join between two tables,,,,,
ms,9,"For a complex join between several tables for which indexes are not used, multiple join buffers might be necessary",,,,,
ms,9,Best left low globally and set high in sessions (by using SET SESSION syntax) that require large full joins,,,,,
ms,9,"In 64-bit platforms, Windows truncates values above 4GB to 4GB-1 with a warning",1,5283,join_buffer_size,P <= 4GB,"Bits = 64, OS = Windows"
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,max_heap_table_size,,,,,
ms,9,This is the maximum size in bytes for user-created MEMORY tables are permitted to grow,,,,,
ms,9,This is helpful when your application is dealing with MEMORY storage engine tables,,,,,
ms,9,Setting the variable while the server is active has no effect on existing tables unless they are recreated or altered,,,,,
ms,9,The smaller of max_heap_table_size and tmp_table_size also limits internal in-memory tables,,,,,
ms,9,"This variable is also in conjunction with tmp_table_size to limit the size of internal in-memory tables (this differs from the tables created explicitly as Engine=MEMORY as it only applies max_heap_table_size), whichever is smaller is applied between the two",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,tmp_table_size,,,,,
ms,9,The largest size for temporary tables in-memory (not MEMORY tables) although if max_heap_table_size is smaller the lower limit will apply,,,,,
ms,9,"If an in-memory temporary table exceeds the limit, MySQL automatically converts it to an on-disk temporary table",,,,,
ms,9,Increase the value of tmp_table_size (and max_heap_table_size if necessary) if you do many advanced GROUP BY queries and you have large available memory space,,,,,
ms,9,You can compare the number of internal on-disk temporary tables created to the total number of internal temporary tables created by comparing the values of the Created_tmp_disk_tables and Created_tmp_tables variables,,,,,
ms,9,"In ClusterControl, you can monitor this via Dashboard -> Temporary Objects graph",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,table_open_cache,,,,,
ms,9,You can increase the value of this variable if you have large number of tables that are frequently accessed in your data set,,,,,
ms,9,"It will be applied for all threads, meaning per connection basis",,,,,
ms,9,The value indicates the maximum number of tables the server can keep open in any one table cache instance,,,,,
ms,9,"Although increasing this value increases the number of file descriptors that mysqld requires, so you might as well consider checking your open_files_limit value or check how large is the SOFT and HARD limit set in your *nix operating system",,,,,
ms,9,You can monitor this whether you need to increase the table cache by checking the Opened_tables status variable,,,,,
ms,9,"If the value of Opened_tables is large and you do not use FLUSH TABLES often (which just forces all tables to be closed and reopened), then you should increase the value of the table_open_cache variable",,,,,
ms,9,"If you have a small value for table_open_cache, and a high number of tables are frequently accessed, this can affect the performance of your server",,,,,
ms,9,"If you notice many entries in the MySQL processlistwith status “Opening tables” or “Closing tables”, then it’s time to adjust the value of this variable but take note of the caveat mentioned earlier",,,,,
ms,9,"In ClusterControl, you can check this under Dashboards -> Table Open Cache Status or Dashboards -> Open Tables",,,,,
ms,9,You can check it here for more info,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,table_open_cache_instances,,,,,
ms,9,"Setting this variable would help improve scalability, and of course, performance which would reduce contention among sessions",,,,,
ms,9,The value you set here limits the number of open tables cache instances,,,,,
ms,9,The open tables cache can be partitioned into several smaller cache instances of size table_open_cache / table_open_cache_instances,,,,,
ms,9,A session needs to lock only one instance to access it for DML statements,,,,,
ms,9,"This segments cache access among instances, permitting higher performance for operations that use the cache when there are many sessions accessing tables",,,,,
ms,9,"(DDL statements still require a lock on the entire cache, but such statements are much less frequent than DML statements",,,,,
ms,9,A value of 8 or 16 is recommended on systems that routinely use 16 or more cores,1,5323,table_open_cache_instances,"P in {8, 16}",Cores >= 16
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,table_definition_cache,,,,,
ms,9,Cache table definitions i,,,,,
ms,9,e,,,,,
ms,9,this is where the CREATE TABLE are cached to speed up opening of tables and only one entry per table,,,,,
ms,9,It would be reasonable to increase the value if you have large number of tables,,,,,
ms,9,"The table definition cache takes less space and does not use file descriptors, unlike the normal table cache",,,,,
ms,9,"Peter Zaitsev of Percona suggest if you can try the setting of the formula below,",,,,,
ms,9,The number of user-defined tables + 10% unless 50K+ tables,1,5329,table_definition_cache,P = tables * 1.1,Tables <= 50000
ms,9,But take note that the default value is based on the following formula capped to a limit of 2000,1,5329,table_definition_cache,P <= 2000,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,"MIN(400 + table_open_cache / 2, 2000)",,,,,
ms,9,"So in case you have larger number of tables compared to the default, then it’s reasonable you increase its value",,,,,
ms,9,"Take into account that with InnoDB, this variable is used as a soft limit of the number of open table instances for the data dictionary cache",,,,,
ms,9,It will apply the LRU mechanism once it exceeds the current value of this variable,,,,,
ms,9,The limit helps address situations in which significant amounts of memory would be used to cache rarely used table instances until the next server restart,,,,,
ms,9,"Hence, parent and child table instances with foreign key relationships are not placed on the LRU list and could impose a higher than the limit defined by table_definition_cache and are not subject to eviction in memory during LRU",,,,,
ms,9,"Additionally, the table_definition_cache defines a soft limit for the number of InnoDB file-per-table tablespaces that can be open at one time, which is also controlled by innodb_open_files and in fact, the highest setting between these variables is used, if both are set",,,,,
ms,9,"If neither variable is set, table_definition_cache, which has a higher default value, is used",,,,,
ms,9,"If the number of open tablespace file handles exceeds the limit defined by table_definition_cache or innodb_open_files, the LRU mechanism searches the tablespace file LRU list for files that are fully flushed and are not currently being extended",,,,,
ms,9,This process is performed each time a new tablespace is opened,,,,,
ms,9,"If there are no “inactive” tablespaces, no tablespace files are closed",,,,,
ms,9,So keep this in mind,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,max_allowed_packet,,,,,
ms,9,This is the per-connection maximum size of an SQL query or row returned,,,,,
ms,9,The value was last increased in MySQL 5.6,,,,,
ms,9,"However in MySQL 8.0 (at least on 8.0.3), the current default value is 64 MiB",,,,,
ms,9,"You might consider adjusting this if you have large BLOB rows that need to be pulled out (or read), otherwise you can leave this default settings with 8.0 but in older versions, default is 4 MiB so you might take care of that in case you encounter ER_NET_PACKET_TOO_LARGE error",1,5352,max_allowed_packet,P = 64 MiB,
ms,9,The largest possible packet that can be transmitted to or from a MySQL 8.0 server or client is 1GB,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,skip_name_resolve,,,,,
ms,9,MySQL server handles incoming connections by hostname resolution,,,,,
ms,9,"By default, MySQL does not disable any hostname resolution which means it will perform a DNS lookups, and by chance, if DNS is slow, it could be the cause of awful performance to your database",,,,,
ms,9,Consider turning this on if you do not need DNS resolution and take advantage of improving your MySQL performance when this DNS lookup is disabled,1,5359,skip_name_resolve,P = on,
ms,9,"Take into account that this variable is not dynamic, therefore a server restart is required if you set this in your MySQL config file",,,,,
ms,9,"You may optionally start mysqld daemon, passing --skip-name-resolve option to enable this",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,max_connections,,,,,
ms,9,This is the number of permitted connections for your MySQL server,,,,,
ms,9,"If you find out the error in MySQL ‘Too many connections’, you might consider setting it higher",,,,,
ms,9,"By default, the value of 151 isn’t enough especially on a production database, and considering that you have greater resources of the server (do not waste your server resources especially if it’s a dedicated MySQL server)",,,,,
ms,9,"However, you must have enough file descriptors otherwise you will run out of them",,,,,
ms,9,"In that case, consider adjusting your SOFT and HARD limit of your *nix operating systems and set a higher value of open_files_limit in MySQL (5000 is the default limit)",,,,,
ms,9,"Take into account that it is very frequent that the application does not close connections to the database correctly, and setting a high max_connections can result to some unresponsive or high load of your server",,,,,
ms,9,Using a connection pool at the application level can help resolve the issue here,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,thread_cache_size,,,,,
ms,9,This is the cache to prevent excessive thread creation,,,,,
ms,9,"When a client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there are fewer than thread_cache_size threads there",,,,,
ms,9,"Requests for threads are satisfied by reusing threads taken from the cache if possible, and only when the cache is empty is a new thread created",,,,,
ms,9,This variable can be increased to improve performance if you have a lot of new connections,,,,,
ms,9,"Normally, this does not provide a notable performance improvement if you have a good thread implementation",,,,,
ms,9,"However, if your server sees hundreds of connections per second you should normally set thread_cache_size high enough so that most new connections use cached threads",,,,,
ms,9,"By examining the difference between the Connections and Threads_created status variables, you can see how efficient the thread cache is",,,,,
ms,9,"Using the formula stated in the documentation, 8 + (max_connections / 100) is good enough",1,5381,thread_cache_size,P = 8 + (max_connections / 100),
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,query_cache_size,,,,,
ms,9,"For some setup, this variable is their worst enemy",,,,,
ms,9,"For some systems experiencing high load and are busy with high reads, this variable will bog you down",,,,,
ms,9,There has been benchmarks that were well-and-tested by e,,,,,
ms,9,g,,,,,
ms,9,Percona,,,,,
ms,9,This variable must be set to 0 along with query_cache_type = 0 as well to turn it off,1,5385,query_cache_size,P = 0,
ms,9,"The good news in MySQL 8.0 is that, the MySQL Team has stopped supporting this, as this variable can really cause performance issues",,,,,
ms,9,I have to agree on their blog that it is unlikely to improve predictability of performance,,,,,
ms,9,"If you are engaged to use query caching, I suggest to use Redis or ProxySQL",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,Storage Engine - InnoDB,,,,,
ms,9,InnoDB is an ACID-compliant storage engine with various features to offer along with foreign key support (Declarative Referential Integrity),,,,,
ms,9,This has a lot of things to say here but certain variables to consider for tuning:,,,,,
ms,9,innodb_buffer_pool_size,,,,,
ms,9,This variable acts like a key buffer of MyISAM but it has lots of things to offer,,,,,
ms,9,"Since InnoDB relies heavily on the buffer pool, you would consider setting this value typically to 70%-80% of your server’s memory",1,5399,innodb_buffer_pool_size;innodb_buffer_pool_size,P >= 0.7 * memory; P <= 0.8 * memory,
ms,9,"It is favorable also that you have a larger memory space than your data set, and setting a higher value for your buffer pool but not by too much",,,,,
ms,9,"In ClusterControl, this can be monitored using our Dashboards -> InnoDB Metrics -> InnoDB Buffer Pool Pages graph",,,,,
ms,9,You may also monitor this with SHOW GLOBAL STATUS using the variables Innodb_buffer_pool_pages*,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,innodb_buffer_pool_instances,,,,,
ms,9,"For your concurrency workload, setting this variable can improve concurrency and reduce contention as different threads of read/write to cached pages",,,,,
ms,9,Minimum innodb_buffer_pool_instances should be lie between 1 (minimum) & 64 (maximum),,,,,
ms,9,"Each page that is stored in or read from the buffer pool is assigned to one of the buffer pool instances randomly, using a hashing function",,,,,
ms,9,"Each buffer pool manages its own free lists, flush lists, LRUs, and all other data structures connected to a buffer pool, and is protected by its own buffer pool mutex",,,,,
ms,9,Take note that this option takes effect only when innodb_buffer_pool_size >= 1GiB and its size is divided among the buffer pool instances,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,innodb_log_file_size,,,,,
ms,9,This variable is the log file in a log group,,,,,
ms,9,The combined size of log files (innodb_log_file_size * innodb_log_files_in_group) cannot exceed a maximum value that is slightly less than 512GB,,,,,
ms,9,"According to Vadim, a bigger log file size is better for performance, but it has a drawback (a significant one) that you need to worry about: the recovery time after a crash",,,,,
ms,9,You need to balance recovery time in the rare event of a crash recovery versus maximizing throughput during peak operations,,,,,
ms,9,This limitation can translate to a 20x longer crash recovery process!,,,,,
ms,9,"To elaborate it, a larger value would be good for InnoDB transaction logs and are crucial for good and stable write performance",,,,,
ms,9,"The larger the value, the less checkpoint flush activity is required in the buffer pool, saving disk I/O",,,,,
ms,9,"However, the recovery process is pretty slow once your database was abnormally shutdown (crash or killed, either OOM or accidental)",,,,,
ms,9,"Ideally, you can have 1-2GiB in production but of course you can adjust this",1,,innodb_log_file_size;innodb_log_file_size,P >= 1Gib; P <= 2GiB,
ms,9,Benchmarking this changes can be a great advantage to see how it performs especially during after a crash,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,innodb_log_buffer_size,,,,,
ms,9,"To save disk I/O, InnoDB’s writes the change data into lt’s log buffer and it uses the value of innodb_log_buffer_size having a default value of 8MiB",,,,,
ms,9,This is beneficial especially for large transactions as it does not need to write the log of changes to disk before transaction commit,,,,,
ms,9,"If your write traffic is too high (inserts, deletes, updates), making the buffer larger saves disk I/O",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit,,,,,
ms,9,When innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit is set to 1 the log buffer is flushed on every transaction commit to the log file on disk and provides maximum data integrity but it also has performance impact,,,,,
ms,9,Setting it to 2 means log buffer is flushed to OS file cache on every transaction commit,,,,,
ms,9,"The implication of 2 is optimal and improves performance if you can relax your ACID requirements, and can afford to lose transactions for the last second or two in case of OS crashes",1,5431,innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit,P = 2,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,innodb_thread_concurrency,,,,,
ms,9,"With improvements to the InnoDB engine, it is recommended to allow the engine to control the concurrency by keeping it to default value (which is zero)",,,,,
ms,9,"If you see concurrency issues, you can tune this variable",,,,,
ms,9,A recommended value is 2 times the number of CPUs plus the number of disks,1,5435,innodb_thread_concurrency,P = 2 * cores + disks,
ms,9,It’s dynamic variable means it can set without restarting MySQL server,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,innodb_flush_method,,,,,
ms,9,This variable though must be tried and tested on which hardware fits you best,,,,,
ms,9,"If you are using a RAID with battery-backed cache, DIRECT_IO helps relieve I/O pressure",1,5441,innodb_flush_method,P = DIRECT_IO,RAID + battery
ms,9,Direct I/O is not cached so it avoids double buffering with buffer pool and filesystem cache,,,,,
ms,9,"If your disk is stored in SAN, O_DSYNC might be faster for a read-heavy workload with mostly SELECT statements",1,5441,innodb_flush_method,P = O_DSYNC,"SAN, read-heavy"
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,innodb_file_per_table,,,,,
ms,9,innodb_file_per_table is ON by default from MySQL 5.6,,,,,
ms,9,This is usually recommended as it avoids having a huge shared tablespace and as it allows you to reclaim space when you drop or truncate a table,,,,,
ms,9,Separate tablespace also benefits for Xtrabackup partial backup scheme,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,innodb_stats_on_metadata,,,,,
ms,9,"This attempts to keep the percentage of dirty pages under control, and before the Innodb plugin, this was really the only way to tune dirty buffer flushing",,,,,
ms,9,"However, I have seen servers with 3% dirty buffers and they are hitting their max checkpoint age",,,,,
ms,9,"The way this increases dirty buffer flushing also doesn’t scale well on high io subsystems, it effectively just doubles the dirty buffer flushing per second when the % dirty pages exceeds this amount",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,innodb_io_capacity,,,,,
ms,9,"This setting, in spite of all our grand hopes that it would allow Innodb to make better use of our IO in all operations, simply controls the amount of dirty page flushing per second (and other background tasks like read-ahead)",,,,,
ms,9,"Make this bigger, you flush more per second",,,,,
ms,9,"This does not adapt, it simply does that many iops every second if there are dirty buffers to flush",,,,,
ms,9,"It will effectively eliminate any optimization of IO consolidation if you have a low enough write workload (that is, dirty pages get flushed almost immediately, we might be better off without a transaction log in this case)",,,,,
ms,9,It also can quickly starve data reads and writes to the transaction log if you set this too high,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,innodb_write_io_threads,,,,,
ms,9,Controls how many threads will have writes in progress to the disk,,,,,
ms,9,I’m not sure why this is still useful if you can use Linux native AIO,,,,,
ms,9,These can also be rendered useless by filesystems that don’t allow parallel writing to the same file by more than one thread (particularly if you have relatively few tables and/or use the global tablespaces),,,,,
ms,9,innodb_adaptive_flushing,,,,,
ms,9,Specifies whether to dynamically adjust the rate of flushing dirty pages in the InnoDB buffer pool based on the workload,,,,,
ms,9,Adjusting the flush rate dynamically is intended to avoid bursts of I/O activity,,,,,
ms,9,"Typically, this is enabled by default",,,,,
ms,9,"This variable, when enabled, tries to be smarter about flushing more aggressively based on the number of dirty pages and the rate of transaction log growth",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,innodb_dedicated_server,,,,,
ms,9,This variable is new in MySQL 8.0 which is applied globally and requires a MySQL restart since it’s not a dynamic variable,,,,,
ms,9,"However, as documentation states that this variable is desired to be enabled only if your MySQL is running on a dedicated server",1,5474,innodb_dedicated_server,P = on,Dedicated server
ms,9,"Otherwise, do not enable this on a shared host or shares system resources with other applications",,,,,
ms,9,"When this is enabled, InnoDB will do an automatic configuration for the amount of memory detected for variables innodb_buffer_pool_size, innodb_log_file_size, innodb_flush_method",,,,,
ms,9,The downside only is that you cannot have the feasibility to apply your desired values on the detected variables mentioned,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,MyISAM,,,,,
ms,9,key_buffer_size,,,,,
ms,9,"InnoDB is the default storage engine now of MySQL, the default for key_buffer_size can probably be decreased unless you are using MyISAM productively as part of your application (but who uses MyISAM in production now?)",,,,,
ms,9,I would suggest here to set perhaps 1% of RAM or 256 MiB at start if you have larger memory and dedicate the remaining memory for your OS cache and InnoDB buffer pool,1,5482,key_buffer_size,P = 0.01 * memory,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,Other Provisions For Performance,,,,,
ms,9,slow_query_log,,,,,
ms,9,"Of course, this variable does not help boost your MySQL server",1,5487,slow_query_log,P = off,
ms,9,"However, this variable can help you out analyze slow performing queries",,,,,
ms,9,Value can be set to 0 or OFF to disable logging,,,,,
ms,9,Setting it to 1 or ON to enable this,,,,,
ms,9,The default value depends on whether the --slow_query_log option is given,,,,,
ms,9,"The destination for log output is controlled by the log_output system variable; if that value is NONE, no log entries are written even if the log is enabled",,,,,
ms,9,You might set the filename or destination of the query log file by setting the variable slow_query_log_file,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,long_query_time,,,,,
ms,9,"If a query takes longer than this many seconds, the server increments the Slow_queries status variable",,,,,
ms,9,"If the slow query log is enabled, the query is logged to the slow query log file",,,,,
ms,9,"This value is measured in real time, not CPU time, so a query that is under the threshold on a lightly loaded system might be above the threshold on a heavily loaded one",,,,,
ms,9,"The minimum and default values of long_query_time are 0 and 10, respectively",,,,,
ms,9,"Take note also that if variable min_examined_row_limit is set > 0, it won’t log queries even if it takes too long if the number of rows returned are less than the value set in min_examined_row_limit",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,"For more info on tuning your slow query logging, check the documentation here",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,sync_binlog,,,,,
ms,9,This variable controls how often MySQL will sync binlogs to the disk,,,,,
ms,9,"By default (>=5.7.7), this is set to 1 which means it will sync to disk before transactions are committed",,,,,
ms,9,"However, this impose a negative impact on performance due to increased number of writes",,,,,
ms,9,But this is the safest setting if you want strictly ACID compliant along with your slaves,,,,,
ms,9,"Alternatively, you can set this to 0 if you want to disable disk synchronization and just rely on the OS to flush the binary log to disk from time to time",1,5505,sync_binlog,P = 0,
ms,9,"Setting it higher than 1 means the binlog is sync to disk after N binary log commit groups have been collected, where N is > 1",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,Dump/Restore Buffer Pool,,,,,
ms,9,It is pretty common thing that your production database needs to warm up from a cold start/restart,,,,,
ms,9,"By dumping the current buffer pool before a restart, it would save the contents from the buffer pool and once it’s up, it’ll load the contents back into the buffer pool",,,,,
ms,9,"Thus, this avoids the need to warm up your database back to the cache",,,,,
ms,9,"Take note that, this version was since introduced in 5.6 but Percona Server 5.5 has it already available, just in case you wonder",,,,,
ms,9,"To enable this feature, set both variables innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown = ON and innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup = ON",1,,innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown;innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup,P = on; P = on,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,Hardware,,,,,
ms,9,"We’re now in 2019, there has been a lot of new hardware improvements",,,,,
ms,9,"Typically, there’s no hard requirement that MySQL would require a specific hardware, but this depends on what you need the database to do",,,,,
ms,9,I would expect that you are not reading this blog because you are doing a test if it runs on an Intel Pentium 200 MHz,,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,"For CPU, faster processors with multiple cores will be optimal for MySQL in most recent versions at least since 5.6",,,,,
ms,9,Intel’s Xeon/Itanium processors can be expensive but tested for scalable and reliable computing platforms,,,,,
ms,9,Amazon has been shipping their EC2 instances running on ARM architecture,,,,,
ms,9,"Though I personally haven’t tried running or recall running MySQL on ARM architecture, there are benchmarks that had been made years ago",,,,,
ms,9,"Modern CPU’s can scale their frequencies up and down based on temperature, load, and OS power saving policies",,,,,
ms,9,"However, there’s a chance that your CPU settings in your Linux OS set to a different governor",,,,,
ms,9,You can check that out or set with “performance” governor by doing the following:,,,,,
ms,9,echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-9]*/cpufreq/scaling_governor,,,,,
ms,9,"For Memory, it is very important that your memory is large and can equate the size of your dataset",,,,,
ms,9,Ensure that you have swappiness = 1,1,,swappiness,P = 1,
ms,9,You can check it out by checking sysctl or checking the file in procfs,,,,,
ms,9,This is achieved by doing the following:,,,,,
ms,9,$ sysctl -e vm,,,,,
ms,9,swappiness,,,,,
ms,9,vm,,,,,
ms,9,swappiness = 1,,,,,
ms,9,Or setting it to a value of 1 as follows,,,,,
ms,9,$ sudo sysctl vm,,,,,
ms,9,swappiness=1,,,,,
ms,9,vm,,,,,
ms,9,swappiness = 1,,,,,
ms,9,Another great thing to consider for your Memory management is considering turning off THP (Transparrent Huge Pages),1,,THP,P = off,
ms,9,"In the past, I do recall we have some weird issues encountered with CPU utilization and thought it was due to disk I/O",,,,,
ms,9,"It turned out, the problem was with kernel khugepaged thread which allocates memory dynamically during runtime",,,,,
ms,9,"Not only this, during kernel goes for defragmentation, your memory will be quickly allocated as it passes it to THP",,,,,
ms,9,"Standard HugePages memory is pre-allocated at startup, and does not change during runtime",,,,,
ms,9,You can verify and disable this by doing the following:,,,,,
ms,9,$ cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled,,,,,
ms,9,"$ echo ""never"" > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled",,,,,
ms,9,"For Disk, it is important that you have a good throughput",,,,,
ms,9,Using RAID10 is the best setup for a database with a battery backup unit,,,,,
ms,9,"With the advent of flash drives that offers high disk throughput and high disk I/O for read/writes, it is important that it can manage the high disk utilization and disk I/O",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,Operating System,,,,,
ms,9,Most production systems running on MySQL runs on Linux,,,,,
ms,9,"It is because MySQL had been tested and benchmarked on Linux, and sounds that it’s the de facto standard for a MySQL installation",,,,,
ms,9,"However, of course, there’s nothing stopping you from using it on Unix or Windows platform",,,,,
ms,9,"It would be easier if your platform has been tested and there is a wide community to help, in case you experience some trouble",,,,,
ms,9,Most setups runs on RHEL/Centos/Fedora and Debian/Ubuntu systems,,,,,
ms,9,"In AWS, Amazon has their Amazon Linux which I see as well being used in production by some",,,,,
ms,9,,,,,,
ms,9,Most important to consider with your setup is that your file system is using either XFS or Ext4,,,,,
ms,9,"For sure, there are pros and cons between these two file systems but I won’t go to the details here",,,,,
ms,9,Some say XFS outperform Ext4 but there are reports as well that Ext4 outperforms XFS,,,,,
ms,9,ZFS is also coming out of the picture as a good candidate for an alternative file system,,,,,
ms,9,"Jervin Real (from Percona) has a great resource on this one, you can check this presentation during the ZFS conference",,,,,
