1,"We set the memory limit per operator (work mem) to 2GB, which results in much better performance due to the more frequent use of in-memory hash joins instead of ex- ternal memory sort-merge joins"
1," Additionally, we set the buffer pool size (sharedbuffers) to 4GB and the size of the operating system’s buffer cache used by PostgreSQL (effective cache size) to 32 GB"
1, For PostgreSQL it is gen- erally recommended to use OS buffering in addition to its own buffer pool and keep most of the memory on the OS side
1," The de- faults for these three settings are very low (MBs, not GBs), which is why increasing them is generally recommended"
1," Finally, by in- creasing the geqo threshold parameter to 18 we forced Post- greSQL to always use dynamic programming instead of falling back to a heuristic for queries with more than 12 joins"
1," Therefore, we disabled nested-loop joins (but not index-nested- loop joins) in all following experiments"
1," As Figure 6b shows, when rerunning all queries without these risky nested-loop joins, we ob- served no more timeouts despite using PostgreSQL’s estimates"
