      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
        <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> is the most advanced
        and flexible Open Source SQL database today.  With this power and
        flexibility comes a problem.  How do the PostgreSQL developers tune the
        default configuration for everyone? Unfortunately the answer is they can't.
        </p>

        <p>
        The problem is that every database is not only different in its design, but
        also its requirements. Some systems are used to log mountains of data that
        is almost never queried. Others have essentially static data that is queried
        constantly, sometimes feverishly.  Most systems however have some, usually
        unequal, level of reads and writes to the database. Add this little
        complexity on top of your totally unique table structure, data, and hardware
        configuration and hopefully you begin to see why tuning can be difficult.
        </p>

        <p>
        The default configuration PostgreSQL ships with is a very solid configuration
        aimed at everyone's best guess as to how an "average" database on "average"
        hardware should be setup. This article aims to help PostgreSQL users of all
        levels better understand PostgreSQL performance tuning.
        </p>

        <h3>Understanding the process</h3>

        <p>
        The first step to learning how to tune your PostgreSQL database is to
        understand the life cycle of a query. Here are the steps of a query:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Transmission of query string to database backend</li>
          <li>Parsing of query string</li>
          <li>Planning of query to optimize retrieval of data</li>
          <li>Retrieval of data from hardware</li>
          <li>Transmission of results to client</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        The first step is the sending of the query string ( the actual SQL
        command you type in or your application uses ) to the database backend.
        There isn't much you can tune about this step, however if you have a
        very large queries that cannot be prepared in advance it may help to
        put them into the database as a stored procedure and cut the data
        transfer down to a minimum.
        </p>

        <p>
        Once the SQL query is inside the database server it is parsed into
        tokens.  This step can also be minimized by using stored procedures.
        </p>

        <p>
        The planning of the query is where PostgreSQL really starts to do some
        work.  This stage checks to see if the query is already prepared if your
        version of PostgreSQL and client library support this feature.  It also
        analyzes your SQL to determine what the most efficient way of retrieving
        your data is. Should we use an index and if so which one? Maybe a hash
        join on those two tables is appropriate?  These are some of the decisions
        the database makes at this point of the process.  This step can be
        eliminated if the query is previously prepared.
        </p>

        <p>
        Now that PostgreSQL has a plan of what it believes to be the best way
        to retrieve the data, it is time to actually get it.  While there
        are some tuning options that help here, this step is mostly effected
        by your hardware configuration.
        </p>

        <p>
        And finally the last step is to transmit the results to the client. While
        there aren't any real tuning options for this step, you should be aware
        that all of the data that you are returning is pulled from the disk and
        sent over the wire to your client.  Minimizing the number of rows and columns
        to only those that are necessary can often increase your performance.
        </p>

        <h3>General Tuning</h3>

        <p>
        There are several postmaster options that can be set that drastically
        affect performance, below is a list of the most commonly used and how
        they effect performance:
        </p>

        <ul class="pgtuning">

        <li>
        <em>max_connections = &lt;num&gt;</em> &mdash; This option sets the
        maximum number of database backend to have at any one time.  Use this
        feature to ensure that you do not launch so many backends that you begin
        swapping to disk and kill the performance of all the children.  Depending
        on your application it may be better to deny the connection entirely
        rather than degrade the performance of all of the other children.
        </li>

        <li>
        <em>shared_buffers = &lt;num&gt;</em> &mdash; Editing this option is the simplest
        way to improve the performance of your database server.  The default
        is pretty low for most modern hardware.  General wisdom says that this should be
        set to roughly 25% of available RAM on the system.  Like most of the options
        I will outline here you will simply need to try them at different levels (both up and down ) and see how well it works on your particular system.  Most people find that setting it larger than a third starts to degrade performance.
        </li>

        <li>
        <em>effective_cache_size = &lt;num&gt;</em> &mdash; This value tells
        PostgreSQL's optimizer how much memory PostgreSQL has available for caching data and helps in determing whether or not it use an index or not.
        The larger the value increases the likely hood of using an index.  This should
        be set to the amount of memory allocated to shared_buffers plus the amount of
        OS cache available.  Often this is more than 50% of the total system memory.
        </li>

        <li>
        <em>work_mem = &lt;num&gt;</em> &mdash; This option is used to control the
        amount of memory using in sort operations and hash tables.  While you may
        need to increase the amount of memory if you do a ton of sorting in your
        application, care needs to be taken.  This isn't a system wide parameter,
        but a per operation one.  So if a complex query has several sort operations
        in it it will use multiple work_mem units of memory.  Not to mention that
        multiple backends could be doing this at once.  This query can often lead
        your database server to swap if the value is too large.  This option was
        previously called <em>sort_mem</em> in older versions of PostgreSQL.
        </li>

        <li>
        <em>max_fsm_pages = &lt;num&gt;</em> &mdash; This option helps to control
        the free space map.  When something is deleted from a table it isn't
        removed from the disk immediately, it is simply marked as "free" in the
        free space map.  The space can then be reused for any new INSERTs that
        you do on the table.  If your setup has a high rate of DELETEs and INSERTs
        it may be necessary increase this value to avoid table bloat.
        </li>

        <li>
        <em>fsync = &lt;boolean&gt;</em> &mdash;  This option determines if
        all your WAL pages are fsync()'ed to disk before a transactions is
        committed.  Having this on is safer, but can reduce write performance. If
        fsync is not enabled there is the chance of unrecoverable data corruption.
        Turn this off at your own risk.
        </li>

        <li>
        <em>commit_delay = &lt;num&gt;</em> and <em>commit_siblings = &lt;num&gt;</em>
        &mdash; These options are used in concert to help improve performance by writing
        out multiple transactions that are committing at once.  If there are commit_siblings number of backends active at the instant your transaction is committing then
        the server waiting commit_delay microseconds to try and commit multiple transactions at once.
        </li>

        <li>
        <em>random_page_cost = &lt;num&gt;</em> &mdash; random_page_cost controls the
        way PostgreSQL views non-sequential disk reads.  A higher value makes it more
        likely that a sequential scan will be used over an index scan indicating that
        your server has very fast disks.
        </li>

        </ul>

            <p style="margin: 0; padding: 5px;">

            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
        Note that many of these options consume shared memory and it will probably
        be necessary to increase the amount of shared memory allowed on your system
        to get the most out of these options.
        </p>

        <h3>Hardware Issues</h3>

        <p>
        Obviously the type and quality of the hardware you use for your database
        server drastically impacts the performance of your database.  Here are
        a few tips to use when purchasing hardware for your database server (in order of importance):
        </p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>RAM</strong> &mdash;  The more RAM you have the more disk
          cache you will have.  This greatly impacts performance considering
          memory I/O is thousands of times faster than disk I/O.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Disk types</strong> &mdash; Obviously fast Ultra-320 SCSI
          disks are your best option, however high end SATA drives are also
          very good.  With SATA each disk is substantially cheaper and with that
          you can afford more spindles than with SCSI on the same budget.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Disk configuration</strong> &mdash; The optimum configuration
          is RAID 1+0 with as many disks as possible and with your transaction log
          (pg_xlog) on a separate disk ( or stripe ) all by itself. RAID 5 is not
          a very good option for databases unless you have more than 6 disks in
          your volume.  With newer versions of PostgreSQL you can also use the
          tablespaces option to put different tables, databases, and indexes on
          different disks to help optimize performance.  Such as putting your often
          used tables on a fast SCSI disk and the less used ones slower
          IDE or SATA drives.
          </li>

          <li><strong>CPUs</strong> &mdash; The more CPUs the better, however
          if your database does not use many complex functions your money is
          best spent on more RAM or a better disk subsystem.
          </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
        In general the more RAM and disk spindles you have in your system the
        better it will perform. This is because with the extra RAM you will
        access your disks less.  And the extra spindles help spread the reads and
        writes over multiple disks to increase throughput and to reduce
        drive head congestion.
        </p>

        <p>
        Another good idea is to separate your application code and your database
        server onto different hardware.  Not only does this provide more hardware
        dedicated to the database server, but the operating system's disk
        cache will contain more PostgreSQL data and not other various application
        or system data this way.
        </p>

        <p>
        For example, if you have one web server and one database server you can
        use a cross-over cable on a separate ethernet interface to handle just
        the web server to database network traffic to ensure you reduce
        any possible bottlenecks there.  You can also obviously create an entirely
        different physical network for database traffic if you have multiple servers
        that access the same database server.
        </p>

        <h3>Useful Tuning Tools</h3>

        <p>
        The most useful tool in tuning your database is the SQL command EXPLAIN ANALYZE.
        This allows you to profile each SQL query your application performs and see
        exactly how the PostgreSQL planner will process the query.  Let's look at
        a short example, below is a simple table structure and query.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-sql">
        CREATE TABLE authors (
            id    int4 PRIMARY KEY,
            name  varchar
        );

        CREATE TABLE books (
            id          int4 PRIMARY KEY,
            author_id   int4,
            title       varchar
        );
        </code></pre>

        <p>
        If we use the query:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-sql">
        EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT authors.name, books.title
        FROM books, authors
        WHERE books.author_id=16 and authors.id = books.author_id
        ORDER BY books.title;
        </code></pre>

        <p>
        You will get output similar to the following:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-sql" style="font-size: 50%;">
        QUERY PLAN
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Sort  (cost=29.71..29.73 rows=6 width=64) (actual time=0.189..16.233 rows=7 loops=1)
           Sort Key: books.title
           ->  Nested Loop  (cost=0.00..29.63 rows=6 width=64) (actual time=0.068..0.129 rows=7 loops=1)
                 ->  Index Scan using authors_pkey on authors  (cost=0.00..5.82 rows=1 width=36) (actual time=0.029..0.033 rows=1 loops=1)
                       Index Cond: (id = 16)
                 ->  Seq Scan on books  (cost=0.00..23.75 rows=6 width=36) (actual time=0.026..0.052 rows=7 loops=1)
                       Filter: (author_id = 16)
         Total runtime: 16.386 ms
        </code></pre>

        <p>
        You need to read this output from bottom to top when analyzing it.  The
        first thing PostgreSQL does is do a sequence scan on the books table looking
        at each author_id column for values that equal 16.  Then it does an index
        scan of the authors table, because of the implicit index created by the PRIMARY
        KEY options.  Then finally the results are sorted by books.title.
        </p>

        <p>
        The values you see in parenthesis are the estimated and actual cost of
        that portion of the query.  The closer together the estimate and the actual
        costs are the better performance you will typically see.
        </p>

            <a href="/services/postgresql/tuning/" title="PostgreSQL Tuning Service">PostgreSQL Tuning Service</a>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
        Now, let's change the structure a little bit by adding an index on
        books.author_id to avoid the sequence scan with this command:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE INDEX books_idx1 on books(author_id);</code></pre>

        <p>
        If you rerun the query again, you won't see any noticeable change in the
        output.  This is because PostgreSQL has not yet re-analyzed the data
        and determined that the new index may help for this query.  This can
        be solved by running:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-sql">ANALYZE books;</code></pre>

        <p>
        However, in this small test case I'm working with the planner still favors
        the sequence scan because there aren't very many rows in my books table.
        If a query is going to return a large portion of a table then the planner
        chooses a sequence scan over an index because it is actually faster. You
        can also force PostgreSQL to favor index scans over sequential scans
        by setting the configuration parameter <em>enable_seqscan</em> to off.
        This doesn't remove all sequence scans, since some tables may not have
        an index, but it does force the planner's hand into always using an
        index scan when it is available.  This is probably best done by sending
        the command <em>SET enable_seqscan = off</em> at the start of every
        connection rather than setting this option database wide.  This way you
        can control via your application code when this is in effect. However,
        in general disabling sequence scans should only be used in tuning
        your application and is not really intended for every day use.
        </p>

        <p>
        Typically the best way to optimize your queries is to use indexes on
        specific columns and combinations of columns to correspond to often used
        queries.  Unfortunately this is done by trial and error.  You should also
        note that increasing the number of indexes on a table increases the number
        of write operations that need to be performed for each INSERT and UPDATE.
        So don't do anything silly and just add indexes for each column in each
        table.
        </p>

        <p>
        You can help PostgreSQL do what you want by playing with the level of
        statistics that are gathered on a table or column with the command:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-sql">ALTER TABLE &lt;table&gt; ALTER COLUMN &lt;column&gt; SET STATISTICS &lt;number&gt;;</code></pre>

        <p>
        This value can be a number between 0 and 1000 and helps PostgreSQL determine
        what level of statistics gathering should be performed on that column.  This
        helps you to control the generated query plans without having slow vacuum
        and analyze operations because of generating large amounts of stats for
        all tables and columns.
        </p>

        <p>
        Another useful tool to help determine how to tune your database is to turn
        on query logging.  You can tell PostgreSQL which queries you are interested
        in logging via the <em>log_statement</em> configuration option. This is
        very useful in situations where you many users executing ad hoc queries
        to your system via something like Crystal Reports or via psql directly.
        </p>

        <h3>Database Design and Layout</h3>

        <p>
        Sometimes the design and layout of your database affects performance.
        For example, if you have an employee database that looks like this:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-sql">
        CREATE TABLE employees (
            id                int4 PRIMARY KEY,
            active            boolean,
            first_name        varchar,
            middle_name       varchar,
            last_name         varchar,
            ssn               varchar,
            address1          varchar,
            address2          varchar,
            city              varchar,
            state             varchar(2),
            zip               varchar,
            home_phone        varchar,
            work_phone        varchar,
            cell_phone        varchar,
            fax_phone         varchar,
            pager_number      varchar,
            business_email    varchar,
            personal_email    varchar,
            salary            int4,
            vacation_days     int2,
            sick_days         int2,
            employee_number   int4,
            office_addr_1     varchar,
            office_addr_2     varchar,
            office_city       varchar,
            office_state      varchar(2),
            office_zip        varchar,
            department        varchar,
            title             varchar,
            supervisor_id     int4
        );
        </code></pre>

        <p>
        This design is easy to understand, but isn't very good on several levels.
        While it will depend on your particular application, in most cases you
        won't need to access all of this data at one time.  In portions of your
        application that deal with HR functions you are probably only interested
        in their name, salary, vacation time, and sick days. However, if the application
        displays an organization chart it would only be concerned with the department
        and supervisor_id portions of the table.
        </p>

        <p>
        By breaking up this table into smaller tables you can get more efficient
        queries since PostgreSQL has less to read through, not to mention better
        functionality. Below is one way to make this structure better:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-sql">
        CREATE TABLE employees (
            id               int4 PRIMARY KEY,
            active           boolean,
            employee_number  int4,
            first_name       varchar,
            middle_name      varchar,
            last_name        varchar,
            department       varchar,
            title            varchar,
            email            varchar
        );

        CREATE TABLE employee_address (
            id               int4 PRIMARY KEY,
            employee_id      int4,
            personal         boolean,
            address_1        varchar,
            address_2        varchar,
            city             varchar,
            state            varchar(2),
            zip              varchar
        );

        CREATE TABLE employee_number_type (
            id               int4 PRIMARY KEY,
            type             varchar
        );

        CREATE TABLE employee_number (
            id               int4 PRIMARY KEY,
            employee_id      int4,
            type_id          int4,
            number           varchar
        );

        CREATE TABLE employee_hr_info (
            id               int4 PRIMARY KEY,
            employee_id      int4,
            ssn              varchar,
            salary           int4,
            vacation_days    int2,
            sick_days        int2
        );

        </code></pre>

        <p>
        With this table structure the data associated with an employee is broken
        out into logical groupings. The main table contains the most frequently
        used information and the other tables store all of the rest of the information.
        The added benefit of this layout is that you can have any number of phone
        numbers and addresses associated with a particular employee now.
        </p>

        <p>
        Another useful tip is to use partial indexes on columns where you typically
        query a certain value more often than another.  Take for example the employee
        table above.  You're probably only displaying active employees
        throughout the majority of the application, but creating a partial index
        on that column where the value is true can help speed up the query and may
        help the planner to choose to use the index in cases where it otherwise
        would not. You can create a partial index like this:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE INDEX employee_idx2 ON employee(active) WHERE active='t';</code></pre>

        <p>
        Or you may have a situation where a row has a column named 'employee_id' that
        is null until the row is associated with an employee, maybe in some trouble
        ticket like system.  In that type of application you would probably have a
        'View Unassigned Tickets' portion of the application which would benefit
        from a partial index such as this:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE INDEX tickets_idx1 ON tickets(employee_id) WHERE employee_id IS NULL;</code></pre>

        <h3>Application Development</h3>

        <p>
        There are many different ways to build applications which use a SQL
        database, but there are two very common themes that I will call
        <em>stateless</em> and <em>stateful</em>. In the area of performance
        there are different issues that impact each.
        </p>

        <p>
        Stateless is typically the access type used by web based applications.  Your
        software connects to the database, issues a couple of queries, returns to
        results to the user, and disconnects.  The next action the users takes
        restarts this process with a new connect, new set of queries, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
        Stateful applications are typically non-web based user interfaces where
        an application initiates a database connection and holds it open for the
        duration the application is in use.
        </p>

        <h4>Stateless Applications</h4>

        <p>
        In web based applications each time something is requested by the user
        , the application initiates a new database connection.
        While PostgreSQL has a very short connection creation time and in general
        it is not a very expensive operation, it is best to use some sort of
        database connection pooling method to get maximum performance.
        </p>

        <p>
        There are several ways to accomplish database connection pooling, here
        is a short list of common ones:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pgpool/" title="PgPool">Pgpool</a> is a small
          server that you run on the same server as your clients that will pool
          database connections to some local or remote server.  The application simply
          points at the pgpool instance instead of the normal postmaster.  From the
          application's perspective nothing has changed as the connection pooling is
          hidden from it.
          </li>

          <li>In a <a href="http://perl.apache.org">mod_perl</a> environment you can
          use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~abh/Apache-DBI/DBI.pm">Apache::DBI</a>
          to handle database connection pooling inside of Apache itself.
          </li>

          <li>
          <a href="http://sqlrelay.sourceforge.net">SQLRelay</a> is another db
           connection manager that is somewhat database agnostic.  It works with
          with several databases other than PostgreSQL.
          </li>

          <li>You can always write a small bit of code to do this for you yourself,
          but I would highly recommend using an already developed solution to reduce
          the amount of debugging you have to do.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        It should be noted that in a few bizarre instances I've actually seen
        database connection pooling reduce the performance of web based applications.
        At a certain point the cost of handling the pooling is more expensive than
        simply creating a new connection.  I suggest testing it both ways to see which
        is best for your environment.
        </p>

        <h4>Stateful Applications</h4>

        <p>
        When building stateful applications you should look into using database
        cursors via the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-declare.html">DECLARE</a> command.  A cursor allows you to plan and execute
        a query, but only pull back the data as you need it, for example one row
        at a time.  This can greatly increase the snappiness of the UI.
        </p>

        <h4>General Application Issues</h4>

        <p>
        These issues typically effect both stateful and stateless applications
        in the same fashion.  One good technique is to use server side prepared
        queries for any queries you execute often.  This reduces the overall
        query time by caching the query plan for later use.
        </p>

        <p>
        It should be noted however if you prepare a query in advance using placeholder
        values ( such as 'column_name = ?' ) then the planner will not always be able
        to choose the best plan.  For example, your query has a placeholder for the
        boolean column 'active' and you have a partial index on false values the
        planner won't use it because it cannot be sure the value passed in on
        execution will be true or false.
        </p>

        <p>
        You can also obviously utilize stored procedures here to reduce the transmit,
        parse, and plan portions of the typical query life cycle.  It is best to
        profile your application and find commonly used queries and data manipulations
        and put them into a stored procedure.
        </p>
