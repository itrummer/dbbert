What is Parallel Vacuum in PostgreSQL 13
Dilip Kumar · April 17, 2020
In PostgreSQL, we already support parallelism of a SQL query which leverages multiple cores to execute the query faster.  Vacuum is one of the most critical utility operations which helps in controlling bloat, one of the major problems for PostgreSQL DBAs.  So, vacuum needs to run really fast to reduce the bloat as early as possible. In PG13, parallel vacuum is introduced which allows for parallel vacuuming of multiple indexes corresponding to a single table.

History of improvements in VACUUM in PostgreSQL
Robert M. Haas · January 5, 2018
In a recent blog post, I talked about why every system that implements MVCC needs some scheme for removing old row versions, and how VACUUM meets that need for PostgreSQL. In this post, I’d like to examine the history of VACUUM improvements in recent years, the state of VACUUM as it exists in PostgreSQL today, and how it might be improved in the future.
MVCC and VACUUM in PostgreSQL
Robert Haas · December 19, 2017
Experienced PostgreSQL users and developers rattle off the terms “MVCC” and “VACUUM” as if everyone should know what they are and how they work, but...

Ameen Abbas · September 17, 2017
I covered vacuum basics in my earlier post. In this post, I'm covering the importance of aggressive autovacuum. Database Administrators who just started their career might have doubts in their mind
How does VACUUM work in PostgreSQL
Richard Yen · August 24, 2017
I recently had a customer who was trying to figure out why his VACUUM-for-wraparound was taking so long–he had a 6TB database, and the VACUUM had been running for over 4 days.
Controlling Autovacuum in PostgreSQL
Bruce Momjian · January 9, 2017
Unlike other database systems, Postgres makes the cleanup process visible and tunable to users. Autovacuum performs recycling of old rows and updates optimizer statistics.
