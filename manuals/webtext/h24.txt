Performance Tuning
Hi,
I'm having some trouble tracking down a performance issue in my code.
I'm pretty certain that it's related to H2, but not 100%...  What I
find is as follows:
1. When using Derby insert time remains constant for inserting
~1million rows
2. When using H2 insert time starts out much lower than Derby, but
once you get past a certain # of rows maybe 150k H2 insert time
rapidly rises.
3. I've tried playing with a couple config options in H2 - notably
CACHE SIZE and MAX_MEMORY_UNDO - increasing these values doesn't seem
to change the performance characteristics very much...
Another quirk is that I'm unable to create a standalone app that
mirrors this problem.  If I build a sample program the insert time
stays constant.
I stuck a profiler on my app to see what the differences were in the
beginning when things look good and later on when performance had
degraded.  In the "good" scenario in 1875 ms I'm able to execute 3142
inserts (1.67 inserts/ms).  There's nothing in the profile stack that
jumps out as being particularly "hot" or taking a long time.
Int the "bad" scenario I'm only able to execute 709 inserts in 2246
ms.  .31 inserts/ms.  I find that 1206 ms is spent in the method
org.h2.store.FileObjectDisk.sync() (34.3% of time).   There is only 1
thread accessing the DB.  this method does not show up at all on the
"good" profile  and it's only invoked 2 times out of the 709 on the
"bad" profile.  Take those two out and you end up with 707 inserts in
1040ms - .67 inserts/ms.  Still not as good as the original but
accounting for a lot of the overhead.
Any ideas on what this could be, things to look for/settings to tweak?
Chris

Re: Performance Tuning
Hi,
It sounds like the problem is FileDescriptor.sync(). I will check if I
can replace this call with a different mechanism, without risking
corrupt databases. But this will take some time.
If you don't care too much about the database getting corrupt during
the import, see
